This text includes characters that require UTF-8 (Unicode) file
encoding:

  ħ (h with stroke)
  łł (l with slash, see below)
  ā ē ī ō ū ȳ ǣ (vowels with macron or “long” mark)
  ẹ̄ ę̄ and ǭ ọ̄, each representing open/closed pairs
  e͞o (eo with shared macron) used as a stand-in for e᷍o

If any of these characters do not display properly--in particular, if
the diacritic does not appear directly above the letter--or if the
apostrophes and quotation marks in this paragraph appear as garbage,
make sure your text reader’s “character set” or “file encoding” is set
to Unicode (UTF-8). You may also need to change the default font. As a
last resort, use the Latin-1 version of the file instead.

Combinations such as ȳ̆ (y with breve and macron) or ọ̄ (o with under-dot
and macron) may not display as intended in all browsers. These forms are
rare. Except for yogh, h-stroke and paired ł, unusual letters appear
only in the editorial material (introduction, notes and glossary).

For this e-text, the printed book’s circumflex accents have been shown
as macrons--that is, ǣ instead of æ̂ and similar--except for “true”
circumflexes in modern French citations and the word “rôle”. The
character shown here as e͞o was printed as “eo” joined by a single
circumflex. In the Trentham MS. of Floriz and Blauncheflur, and
a few times in the Assumption, some letters were printed with “end
flourishes” (see Introduction under “Manuscripts”). All are shown here
as a free-standing tilde ~ after the letter. In the same passages, the
double letter “ll” printed with a joining wavy line is shown as łł.

In the primary texts, italics representing editorial expansions are
shown with {braces}. Roman (non-italic) words within italic passages are
shown the same way. Other italics are shown conventionally with _lines_.
Boldface is shown as #A#, #B#. Large initial letters are shown with
double or triple preceding + as ++Horn, +++Alle to avoid “breaking” the
text. The number of + signs reflects the size of the original (two lines
or more).

Footnotes have been numbered continuously through the Introduction, and
separately for each of the three original texts. For mechanical reasons
some footnotes in the primary text will seem to be out of order. Line
numbering is by multiples of 4.

PREFACE.


The triple labour involved in editing three independent works in one
volume will, it is hoped, serve as an excuse for some of the
shortcomings of the present publication. Under the circumstances it has
been impossible to make the work as definitive as might have been the
case with a single text. For example, while I have been able to print
the three existing manuscript texts of King Horn, of the other two
poems, the textual material is not nearly so complete.

The texts, it is hoped, are accurately printed. The credit for this is
due, in large measure, to Dr. Furnivall,--who has read with the MSS. the
proofs of all the British Museum texts,--and to the proof-readers at
Oxford and Cambridge. The notes to King Horn represent a good deal of
labour, and may, I trust, prove useful. The glossary, though not so
complete as that in Wissmann’s excellent critical edition of King Horn,
is intended to fit the volume, and to supply explanation of words and
uses of words not intelligible to ordinary readers of Early English
Texts.

It is my pleasant duty to acknowledge assistance from various quarters.
I am indebted to the libraries of the British Museum and Cambridge
University, and the Bodleian library at Oxford for the use of
manuscripts; also to the Duke of Sutherland for permission to copy the
text of Floris and Blauncheflur from the manuscript in his private
library; also to the Cornell University library for conveniences placed
at my disposal in the preparation of this volume. I must also
acknowledge timely words of advice from Prof. J. M. Hart, notes on
Layamon from Dr. B. S. Monroe, and assistance in proof-reading by Prof.
W. Strunk, jr. But above all I must acknowledge the less apparent work
of Dr. Furnivall in preparing the texts for press, a work the amount of
which one who has not edited for the E.E.T.S. is not likely to realize.

§ 1. SETTING OF THE STORY.

By the beginning of the 13th century, when literature in the English
tongue began to show some signs of revival, the earlier English epic
tales seem to have been almost entirely obliterated from memory. A
solitary survival seems to have been the story of the dragon-killing
Wade with his famous boat Guingelot; but even this story is lost to us
save for occasional references,[I-1] and from these we must infer that
all definite idea of its origin was lost, since Wade is associated, now
with Weyland, now with Horn and Havelok, now with Lancelot. The place of
these earlier epic tales was filled in Middle English times by a new set
of tales for the most part no longer of purely native, popular origin.
Tales were imported from every conceivable quarter, though usually by
way of France, and even in the popular romances of Guy of Warwick and
Bevis of Hampton, which are supposed to contain a kernel of genuine
English tradition, the original story is almost unrecognizable amid the
embellishments added. Similarly in the stories of Waldef and Hereward
the historical facts are almost lost amid this mass of added foreign
matter, and in the late romance of Richard Cœur de Lion we have to do,
not with the historical Richard, but with a conventionalized hero of
mediæval romance.

Standing apart from these largely conventionalized tales are the stories
of Havelok and King Horn. These are supposed to have been among the
first products of the second growth of English story. They seem to
preserve, more than the other, later romances, their primitive traits,
and are hence usually classed as English, or Germanic, in origin.

    and Tr. and C. iii, 614.]


§ 2. VERSIONS.

The story of Horn is known in several different versions. Of these the
one printed in the present volume is the oldest and in many respects the
most archaic. The story, which it will be unnecessary to summarize here,
is told in a simple, direct style with a noticeable lack of unnecessary
description inserted for embellishment. The explanation of the peculiar
features of this version is no doubt to be found in the purpose for
which this version was used. It was probably intended to be sung, as one
would infer from the opening lines, and perhaps is such a song, or
ballad, as the one which, as the French version informs us (R. H. 2776
ff. cf. p. xiv. below), Horn sang about his love Rigmenil. The manner of
the narrative is determined by the song character of the poem. There is
more detail than in a modern song, at the same time less detail than in
a modern story. Events are sometimes simply referred to as though
already known instead of being fully described. The bravery of Murry,
Horn’s father, is alluded to in such a manner as to lead one to expect
to hear more about his feats of prowess. No motive is given for the
journey to Ireland. We are conducted from place to place with Horn, from
Aylmer’s court in Westernesse to that of Thurston, or from Horn’s
wedding feast at Aylmer’s court to the annihilation of the Saracen
invaders of Suddenne, almost in a breath. In this way sometimes
incidents are thrown absurdly out of perspective. For instance, when
Horn wishes to ‘prove his knighthood’ (v. 588), while the others are at
table, he sets out on his ‘fole,’ and at the seashore finds a shipload
of _heþene honde_. He slays about a hundred of them. _At eureche dunte
þe heued of wente._ He fixes the leader’s head on the point of his sword
and thus returns to the hall. All this, which forms the matter for about
four hundred twelve-syllabled lines in the more prolix French version,
is here related in an off-hand manner, in about forty short lines. The
pitched battle of the French version becomes here a mere after-dinner
recreation. It would be possible to multiply instances (cf. pp. x-xii)
showing the abridged character of the present version.

Very different from the English gleeman’s version, is the highly
elaborated French version of the story. This version,[I-2] which is
preserved in three MSS. at Oxford, at Cambridge, and at London, consists
of about 5250 lines of twelve syllables, arranged in _laisses_, or
strophes, of about twenty lines bound together by a single rime. Here we
have a full-fledged romance, with descriptions of rich adornments, of
feastings, of battles, of games, and of tournaments quite in the manner
of the contemporary romances current in France and in Norman England.
The archaic traits of the English King Horn are no longer so obvious.
The names of persons and of places, with the exception of those of Horn,
Rymenhild : Rigmel (Rigmenil), Fiken(h)ild : Wikele, Modi : Modin,
Westernesse : Westir (Yrlaunde), and Sudden(n)e, are quite different in
the two versions.

But with all this difference of detail, the story in its essential
elements is the same in the two versions. Wissmann,[I-3] in the
introduction to his critical edition, says, “der französische roman
(R. H.) weist kein einziges notwendiges bindeglied, keinen schönen
altertümlichen zug auf, den das englische gedicht, King Horn (K. H.)
nicht enthielte; dieses dagegen hat trotz seines geringen umfanges, eine
reiche von alten, wahrhaft poetischen motiven jenem voraus.” And
further, “aus alle dem ergibt sich, dass K. H. keine bearbeitung des
französischen romans sein kann.” Wissmann’s further conclusions,
however, are less tenable, when he continues: “das umgekehrte
verhältniss dagegen ist nicht nur denkbar, sondern bis zu einem gewissen
grade sogar notwendig; eine ältere quelle als das lied von King Horn für
R. H. vorauszusetzen sind wir durch nichts berechtigt.”

Limited space forbids a thorough-going comparison of the two versions.
The essential elements of the story are in each case nearly the same. In
the French version (R. H.) again Horn the prince with his companions is
set afloat from Suddenne in an open boat, arrives in Bretaigne, is
hospitably received by King Hunlaf, is loved by the princess Rigmenil,
from whom he receives a magic ring, is betrayed by Wikele, one of his
companions, and is exiled from Bretaigne. He takes ship for Westir, the
court of King Godreche, and is well received by the king and his two
sons. He distinguishes himself in all things, and is loved and wooed by
the princess Lemburc. But after delivering the Irish kingdom (Westir)
from an African invasion, he is recalled by a messenger to Bretaigne,
where, after vanquishing his rival Modun in a tournament, he rescues
Rigmenil and himself plays the part of bridegroom at the wedding
prepared. He then repairs to Suddenne, and after ridding his father’s
kingdom of the invaders, is warned in a dream of Wikele’s second
treachery, and returns again just in time to save his bride from a
forced marriage with Wikele. With the death of Wikele and the
establishment of Horn’s loyal friend Haderof (Athulf) in Ireland and of
Horn and Rigmenil in Suddenne, the French story ends.

In addition to this similarity in general outline must be mentioned
occasional parallelism between the two versions in minor details or even
in phraseology. As instances of the first we may cite: _Of his feire
siȝte Al þe bur gan liȝte_ K. H. 385-6; _De la belte de horn tute la
chambre resplent._ R. H. 1053. _Drink to horn of horne_ K. H. 1145; _Mes
com apelent horn li engleis naturer_ R. H. 4206. _He lokede on his rynge
And þoȝte on Rymenhilde_ K. H. 873-4; _Si regarde sa main e lanel kest
gemmeȝ_. _Ke li fud de Rimel al departir doneȝ_ R. H. 3166-7. _And whan
þu farst to woȝe tak him þine gloue_ K. H. 793-4; _Mes une rien uus di
joe dont seieȝ purgardez, Si alez donneier ke oue uus nel menez Kar il
est de beaute issi enluminez ke uus la v il iert petit serreȝ preiseȝ_
R. H. 2323-6. _Biuore me to kerue And of þe cupe serue_ K. H. 233-4;
_Horn me seruira vi de ma cupe portant_ R. H. 463. As instances of
phrases from King Horn reflected in R. H., we may cite: _Stiwarde, tak
nu here Mi fundlyng for to lere Of þine mestere, Of wude and of riuere_
K. H. 227-30; _De bois de riueer refet il altre tal_ R. H. 377. _Wiþute
sail and roþer_ K. H. 188; _Kil naient auirun dunt a (!) seient aidanȝ
Sigle ne guuernad (!) dunt il seint naianȝ_ R. H. 60-61. _Ston he dude
lade, ant lym þerto he made_ K. H. 1502 H. _Vn castel ad ia fet de pere
e de furment_ R. H. 5097. These instances, which might be multiplied,
will serve to show how closely related in origin are these two versions,
English and French.

The identity of the two versions is, however, by no means complete. The
more condensed version (K. H.) presents some traits not to be found in
R. H. We may mention: Horn’s farewell to his boat, 139 ff.; Rimenhild’s
assistance in bringing about the dubbing of Horn, 435 ff.; Rimenhild’s
dream, 651 ff.; Horn’s charge to Athulf to care for Rimenhild, 743 ff.;
the drowning of the messenger from Rimenhild to Horn, 968 ff.; the
palmer’s account of Rimenhild’s grief, 1035 ff.; Athulf’s watching from
the tower, 1091 ff.; Horn’s fictitious tale to Rimenhild of his own
death, 1175 ff.

If K. H. offers these few traits independent of R. H., the latter,
longer narrative introduces episode after episode either barely
suggested in a single line of K. H., or entirely foreign to the English
version. For example, we may mention: the more circumstantial account of
Horn’s descent, and of the heroic death of Aaluf, 250 ff.; Rimel’s
amusing method of wheedling Athelfrus into bringing Horn to her, 604
ff.; her confidences to her maid Herselot, 729 ff.; the elaborate
account of Horn’s victory over Malbroin and Rodmund, 1295 ff.; Wikele’s
contrived pretext for a quarrel with Horn, 1839 ff.; Horn’s loathness to
take oath, though he is willing to vindicate his word by meeting in
combat any two or even five or six chosen antagonists, 1924 ff.; the
love of princess Lemburc for Horn, 2394 ff.; the stone-throwing contest,
2568 ff.; the game of chess, 2696 ff.; Lemburc’s apartments, 2709 ff.;
the harp-playing, 2776 ff.; the elaborate battle description once more,
3234 ff.; the death of Egfer, 3358 ff.; the meeting of Horn with Wikele
and Modin, 4094 ff.; the tournament at Rimil’s wedding, 4456 ff.; the
victory, with Hardre’s aid, over the Saracens in Suddenne, 4604 ff.; the
touching description of Horn’s meeting with his mother, 4882 ff.; the
besiegement of Hunlaf and Rimel by Wikele, 5100 ff.; the intervention of
Wikele’s brother, Wothere, 5052 ff., etc.[I-4]

If the subject matter in the two versions is different, the style is far
more so. The simple, condensed, somewhat archaic manner of K. H. stands
in marked contrast to the sophisticated style of the French romance. The
difference is perhaps that to be expected between two versions, one
intended for English-speaking, the other for French-speaking
people.[I-5] But the difference is perhaps more largely that between
ballad and romance. In K. H. the author gives no evidence of himself
directly or indirectly, whereas Thomas, the author of R. H., continually
addresses his public in the second person and directly introduces his
personal opinion. The incidents which in K. H. are condensed almost to
unintelligibility, in R. H. are liberally supplied with motives and
explanations. The character of Rimenhild in K. H., almost wild in its
naturalness, suggests somewhat one of the female divinities of Germanic
mythology. Rimel, of the French romance, is an eminently sophisticated,
almost modern young woman who understands the arts of coaxing and of
coquetry.

The luxury and refinement described in the French version, contrast[I-6]
markedly with the primitive manners and surroundings suggested in the
English version. Rimenhild shares her single sleeping-room with her six
maidens; Rimel has so many maids that these have private rooms, Rimel
keeping by her only her one trusted maid. Rimenhild on her wedding day,
has four maid attendants; Rimel, thirty. King Murry’s retinue consists
of two knights, and the sons of the king of Westir appear to have been
without retinue; in R. H. the two princes in their _mesnée privée_ have
_vingt de gens ben escernée_. Even the seneschal of King Hunlaf has
twenty knights in his retinue. Stimming further points out the
feudalistic relations existing between Horn and his companions in R. H.
(as well as in H. C.) of which one can hardly detect a trace in K. H.
Further the author of the romance, quite in keeping with the conventions
of contemporary romances, has introduced and elaborated descriptions of
battles and of sports and tournaments on every possible occasion. In
R. H. Horn is a _curteis_ knight, whose knightly honour forbids him to
take oath.

Stimming further points out the difference in cultivation of manner as
reflected in the love-making scenes of the two versions. When Athulf is
introduced to Rimenhild’s bower, _Anon vpon Aþulf child Rymenhild gan
wexe wild_, K. H. 295-6, she has him seat himself on her bed, embraces
him, and offers herself as his bride. Rimel, on the other hand, who
before Aþulf’s coming has carefully regarded the glass, _pur veer sa
belted, Pur saver de su vis cum il est culured_, on his appearance,
takes him by the hand, leads him to a seat, seats herself beside him,
and then expresses the wish, “_Bels amis, dès ore voil estre mise en
vostre justise_,” politely adding, “_si vostre plaisir est_.”

All this, Stimming concludes, is an unmistakable evidence of the later
time of R. H.’s composition. Granting the truth of this conclusion, the
difference of treatment in the two versions is also no doubt in part due
to the difference in the public for which each version was intended, and
also still more, perhaps, to the difference in function of the two
works. It must be noted that K. H. is a popular ballad-like poem perhaps
of the kind referred to in R. H., while the French R. H. is an
artificial and conventionalized romance of prowess and love.

That the ballad-like version K. H., simple, even primitive in matter, in
manner, and in metrical form, should have been derived from the
sophisticated, artificial romance, R. H. deserves little consideration.
On the other hand that the artificial romance should have been derived
from the simple ballad-like story, incomplete in its record of details,
is even more unworthy of consideration, though quite probably Thomas,
the French romancer, may have been to some extent influenced by this
English version, with which he was probably acquainted, as we may infer
from the following passage:

  _Mes un lai ai oi dunt ioe sai la meitie
  Si iol sousse tut, par ma crestiente
  En cest nostre pais nad taunt bone cite
  Ki tant me fust a main e á ma uolente
  Ke ainz ne la perdisse ke lousse ublie
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  Mut en auez oi parler en cest regne
  E de lamur de horn ke ele od taunt ame
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  Coe est ueir dist Guffer, Rigmel est mut loéé
  Bele soeur de beaute en meinte cuntréé
  E de horn ai oi meinte feiz renoméé
  Quil est pruz e uallanz e corteis sanz pounéé._

    R. H. 2783-2801.

The French romance is no doubt constructed from an English story, as we
may infer from the proper names, which in general seem to be Germanic
in origin, from occasional English words, _e.g._ _welcumeȝ_ 800, _wite
God_, _wrec_ 150, etc., from references to English such as, _Mes com
apelent horn li engleis_, R. H. 4206, and especially from the general
features of the story which seem to be Germanic. Further, “in the
introduction to the French romance of Waldelf we are informed that the
romance of Horn was taken from an English original” (T. Wright, Essays
on Middle Ages, I, 102. London, 1846). The English gleeman’s version
quite likely was composed directly from oral tradition, while the
romance rests upon some version of the story, the “_parchemin_” so often
referred to. This hypothetical version, judging from the identity of the
story in its main outline with that in K. H., must be the version upon
which R. H. rests also, or must rest upon the same tradition with K. H.

A third version of the story of Horn is the romance of Horn Childe and
Maiden Rimnild, the only copy of which is the incomplete one contained
in the famous collection of the Auchinleck MS. of the 14th century. (One
leaf lost in the middle and one or two at the end.) Of this romance,
which is composed in twelve-lined strophes, _rime couée_, there are
preserved 1136 lines, that is to say, 96 strophes, not all complete. The
story, very briefly summarized, is as follows:

Haþeolf, king of “_al Ingelond fram Humber norþ_,” has one son named
Horn. To Horn Haþeolf gives eight companions and puts all under the
instruction of Arlaund. Haþeolf annihilates a host of Danish invaders,
but within nine months is again attacked, this time by three kings from
Ireland, and after an heroic fight, in which he slays five thousand, is
stoned to death, and “_an erle of Northumberland_” seizes the kingdom.

Herlaund conducts the nine boys “_fer souþe in Inglond_,” where they
are received by Houlac the king. The king’s only daughter, Rimneld,
loves him and asks Herlaund to bring Horn to her bower. As in the other
versions, Arlaund first brings Haþerof, but the second time brings Horn
to Rimneld, and the princess gives Horn rich presents, and promises to
be his if he shall be dubbed knight. But Wikard and Wikel, two of Horn’s
companions, calumniate Horn and Rimneld to the king, and Horn is
banished. After vain attempts at a reconciliation with the king, he
takes leave of Rimneld, who gives him a ring with a magic stone:

  “_When þe ston wexeþ wan
  Þan chaungeþ þe þought of þi leman
  When þe ston wexeþ rede
  Þan haue y lorn mi maidenhed._”

Horn takes the name of Godebounde, has heroic adventure in the forest,
wins a great tournament in Wales, then crosses over to Ireland, and
delivers king Finlawe (Finlak) from his enemy, Malkan, the one who had
slain Horn’s father. Atula, Finlak’s daughter, loves Horn, but he
remains true to Rimneld, notices that the stone in his ring has turned
pale, and with a hundred knights, crosses over into England in time to
save Rimneld from marrying King Moioun, overthrows Moioun in the
tournament, slays Wigard and smites out the eye of the false Wiȝel,
Wigard’s brother. Horn marries Rimneld, and, after five days of
feasting, makes ready a force to go into _North-Humberland_ to win back
his father’s kingdom. The single MS. ends abruptly at this point.

It will be seen that the main outline of the story as told in the other
two versions, is here preserved, but with many modifications, with some
omissions and some additions. The scene of action has shifted. We hear
no more of the to us obscure names Suddenne and Westir; the whole action
takes place in the British isles. The names of the persons, too, are
greatly transformed, Horn and Rimneld, and possibly Moioun being about
the only names common to all the versions. The whole introduction of the
present version, dealing with the bravery and death of Haþeolf, Horn’s
father, which forms about a quarter of this romance version as preserved
to us, is entirely strange to K. H. and to R. H. Other features peculiar
to H. C. are: Haþeolf’s instructions to the boy companions of Horn, to
bear fealty to Horn, 137 ff.; the fine gifts and rich entertainment by
Rimnild of Herlaund and Haderof and, later, of Horn, 330 ff., 377 ff.;
the manner of the courtship, where Horn no longer plays the reluctant
part, urging his poverty as an excuse, 373 ff.; the episode of the
departure of Horn’s companions Tebeaud, Winwald, Garins and Aþelston for
foreign lands, 445 ff. Wikel here does not accuse Horn of designs on the
king’s life and kingdom, 486 ff. Horn remains at home from the hunting,
not to visit Rimnild, but “_for blodeleteing, Al for a maladye_.” 485
ff. There is no Saracen invasion of Houlac’s kingdom. Horn tries to
appease the king, 541 ff. The ring has a different function, 571 ff. The
ring it is that prompts Horn’s return to Rimnild. Still other features
peculiar to this edition are: the heroic adventure in the forest, 613
ff.; the tournament at the court of Elidan in Wales, 664 ff.; and the
whole account of Horn’s experiences in Ireland, the occasion of his
journey there, the character of the battle (in which Horn is wounded),
and the absence of mention of king Finlak’s proposal to give his
daughter and kingdom to Horn.

All these independent traits in H. C. lead us to conclude that this
version must rest, directly or indirectly, on a tradition different from
that underlying K. H. and R. H. That, as Stimming thinks probable, the
writer “unmittelbar aus der sage selbst geschöpft” seems unlikely
considering the highly sophisticated[I-7] nature and artificial form of
this version, and the frequent remarks of the author, “_in boke as we
rede_,” etc. More likely it rests directly on an earlier version of the
story, which in its turn rests on a Northern tradition of the story.
That such a Northern tradition existed we have evidence in the Scottish
ballads of Hind Horn [Child’s (F. J.) English and Scottish Ballads.
Boston, 1882-84], which while emphasizing only one element, the
separation of the two lovers and their reunion through the agency of the
magic ring, agree with the H. C. version rather than with that of K. H.
and R. H.

What, then, is the relation of H. C. to K. H. and to R. H.? Wissmann
says, apparently with truth: “Das Gedicht von Horn Childe hat von dem
Gehalt des K. H. nichts bewahrt, was nicht auch R. H. hätte.” On the
other hand H. C. has a number of important traits in common with R. H.,
for instance, the names: Herland (R. H.); Herlaund, Arlaund, Harlaund,
Arlond, etc. (H. C.); Allof (R. H.); Haþeolf (H. C.); Wikel (R. H.);
Wiȝel (H. C.); Haþerof (R. H.); Haderof (H. C.) and Hunlaf (R. H.);
Houlac (H. C.); further, Haderof’s ignorance of Herland’s intention to
palm him off as Horn, the love of the Irish princess for Horn, Horn’s
meeting with Moioun (Moging) and Wikard, and his riddle of the net told
here, the tournament and the contest between Horn and Moioun, Horn’s
thanks to king Houlac (Hunlaf). From the considerable French element in
the vocabulary of H. C., including frequent rime words, the French form
Cornwayle riming with the French phrase _saun faile_, it is reasonable
to suppose that the author was acquainted with French, and the general
tone of the romance, the feudalism inculcated by King Haþeolf, 133 ff.,
the tournaments and the general air of luxury in addition to the
above-mentioned striking traits in common with R. H., suggest almost
inevitably that the author of H. C. must have been acquainted with, and
influenced by, the French version.

The Scottish ballads of Hind Horn (cf. Child, as above, I, 187), as said
above, emphasize only one element of the original story, namely, the
separation of Horn and the princess, and their reunion through the
agency of the magic ring. The story in Hind Horn agrees more closely
(notably in the function of the ring, peculiar to the Northern versions)
with H. C. than with R. H. or K. H., and seems to rest, along with H.
C., on a northern version of the story.

The later French romance _Ponthus et la belle Sidoine_ is an adaptation
of the French version (R. H.) of the Horn story. It is purely an
artificial product based on R. H., and has little bearing on the origin
and history of the version in hand. It is interesting in this connection
as showing how possible it is to tell the same story with different
names, the only name in common between R. H., and the adaptation being
that of the steward Herlant. (Cf. English translation, King Ponthus and
the Fair Sidone, edited by F. J. Mather, Publ. of the Mod. Lang. Assoc.
of America, xii, 1-150.) The story of Ponthus also appears in a German
_Volksbuch_ (cf. Simrock, I. 1 ff.).

§ 3. ELEMENTS OF THE STORY.

The story of Horn, it is generally believed, had its origin in the
turbulent times of the Danish invasions, but the kernel of genuine
historical tradition is probably small. How the different elements in
such a story aggregate, we can plainly see in the case of the
_Hereward_: “The writer of the life of Hereward,” according to Wright,
“had, among other sources of information, the work of the presbyter,
Leofric, Hereward’s archdeacon. This Leofric, he tells us, occupied
himself in collecting for the edification of his hearers, all the acts
of the giants and warriors from the fables of the ancients, or, in the
instance of more modern heroes, from the trustworthy relations of those
who had known them, and in writing them in English that they might be
preserved in people’s memories.” In this way grew the _Hereward_ story,
and in a similar manner, we may suppose, that the story of Horn
attracted to itself many new and foreign elements, receiving its
development and final form probably at the hands of the _jongleurs_, or
gleemen, whom we are to think of as wandering widely and gathering
romantic material from the most remote regions.

In another place (Publ. of the Mod. Lang. Assoc. of America, xv.
221-232) I have attempted to point out some of the ‘Germanic elements’
in the story. It seems possible to distinguish two essential elements in
the story: (1) Horn’s expulsion from his kingdom and his return and
avengement of his father’s death; (2) the separation and reunion of the
faithful lovers. Of these elements the first seems to be especially
Germanic. At least historic incidents which might supply the nucleus for
such a tale were particularly common in connection with the continual
wars between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and also with the invasions of
England, Danish and Norman. (Cf. the death of Beaduheard. Eng. Chron.
(Winch.) a. 787, also the death of Aethelwulf at hands of Danes, avenged
by his brother Aethelstan. Gaimar, 2391 ff.) The second element also may
have been of Germanic origin, though it has become greatly
conventionalized and has come to be the more prominent element in the
story. The minor features of the story, though often purely
conventional, and, therefore, belonging to no distinct nationality, at
times show Germanic traits, as for instance in the _comitatus_ relation
existing between Horn and his followers, in the manner of wooing and of
wedding, in the etiquette of the feasts, in the etiquette of the duel,
and in the formal challenge on the part of a champion of an invading
host, to a duel upon the result of which shall depend the marriage of a
princess or the fate of a kingdom (cf. Mod. Lang. Assoc. Publ., as
above, pp. 228-231).

The story as it is preserved in K. H., the earliest of existing
versions, is no doubt a greatly expanded form of the original nucleus.
The timely rescue of the princess from a forced marriage, which in the
Scottish ballad has been preserved at the expense of the complete loss
of the other element, the recovery of the kingdom and the avengement of
the father’s death, even in the earlier K. H. version has come quite to
overshadow the recovery and revenge element. It seems very probable also
that there has been a duplication of the rescue scene, due either to the
desire of the _jongleur_, or minstrel, to repeat a successful climax, or
to a blending of two versions of the same story, a not at all uncommon
feature in such romances,[I-8] and that the second rescue scene, with
its more archaic and more particularly Germanic features, represents the
sole turning-point in an earlier and simpler version, the first and more
conventional rescue scene being an expansion contributed by a later
composer. All this, which rests largely on conjecture, would assume for
the nucleus of the story a relatively simple incident in which there are
involved only two places, the kingdom from which the prince is expelled
and which he regains, and the kingdom where he finds refuge.

    [Footnote I-8: Cf. the seeming duplication of names, Rymenhild,
    Reymyld etc.; Reynild, Ermenyld, etc., all of which may have come
    from an original Eormenhild (cf. OE. Leechdoms), the variants
    being due to metathesis as in OE. _yrnan_ : _rinnan_. Cf. also the
    explanation of Westernesse below, p. xx.]


§ 4. TOPOGRAPHY.

The topography of the Horn story offers some difficult but interesting
problems. In the northern version (H. C.) all is made relatively clear.
The author of this version assigns the events to very definite places.
Horn’s father is king of “_al Ingelond fram Humber norþ_.” He repels a
Danish invasion on the east coast, and is slain by invaders from
Ireland. Horn and his companions take refuge “_fer souþe in Inglond_.”
Thence Horn goes in exile to Wales and later into Ireland. The Norman
_trouvère_, also, clarifies matters somewhat by assigning definite names
to two of the three kingdoms involved, Bretaigne and Westir (_Ki ore est
Hirlonde lors westir fu apelee_, 2184, H). But both the Norman and the
older English versions have consistently the perplexing name Sudenne
(Sodenne); and the earlier English version has also the vague name
Westernesse (Westnesse), leaving as a certain starting-point in our
study of the topography only Yrlonde, also referred to as _westene lond_
(754 H).

From internal evidence in King Horn we learn little that is definite
about the situation of Suddenne. In drifting from Suddenne to
Westernesse, Horn and his companions spend “_Al þe day and al þe niȝt,
Til hit sprang dai liȝt_,” K. H. 122-3; and again we are told of the
same voyage “_Dai hit is igon and oþer, Wiþute sail and roþer_,” 187-8.
On the return voyage to Suddenne, _Biþinne daies fiue, þat schup gan
ariue_, 1295-6. On hearing of Fikenhild’s second treachery Horn
exclaims, “_Crist for his wundes fiue, To niȝt me þuder driue_,” 1423-4,
and then, _Er þan horn hit wiste, To fore þe sunne vpriste, His schup
stod vndur ture At Rymenhilde bure_, 1435-39. From all which we can only
conclude that ideas of direction and distance are very vague in the mind
of the English composer.

In regard to the kingdom of Suddenne, some have thought that the name
must be connected with _Suðdene_ mentioned in Beowulf, which would make
Suddenne refer to some place in northern Europe, possibly in Denmark.
(Parallelism with the _Havelok_ would also support this opinion.) But
neither the proper names of the story, nor the phonology of the word
Suddenne itself, support this view. Ward[I-9] suggests that the name is
a mere vague poetical designation, and brings together historical facts
and internal evidence in the attempt to determine the definite place. He
cites the name Hornesbeorh on the Isle of Purbeck, Dorsetshire, calls
attention to the phrase in King Horn, “_y come into þis yle_,” referring
to the Sarazin incursion in which Horn’s father was killed, and from the
fact that “it was upon Dorsetshire that a descent of the Northmen took
place, which was the first recorded appearance in Wessex, and which
evidently made a great impression upon the people,” concludes that
“Dorsetshire has a very fair claim to be considered the birthplace of
the Horn legend.”

One is loath, however, to let go the only thread that seems to lead to
an explanation of the name Suddenne itself. Francisque Michel was the
first to point out that in the Brit. Mus. text of Gaimar’s _L’estorie
des Engleis_, one reads that “_Edelbrit fu feit reis de Kent E de
Sudeine ensement_,” vv. 955-6. In spite of the fact that the other three
versions have; one, Surrie, the other two Suthreie, one is tempted to
cling to this clew, and the fact that in the same manuscript later,
Gaimar, in referring to the same political division says,[I-10] “_Puis
regnat son fiȝ, E Adelstán, un rei gentils, Li uns out Westsexe, e
laltre Kent, Suthdreie, e Suthsexe ensement_, vv. 2388-91, gives ground
for the supposition that Sudeine[I-11] may refer collectively to Surrey
and Sussex. In that case the coast of Sussex was probably the scene of
the first act in the Horn drama.

Whichever of these views is the true one, we may be reasonably certain
that the Suddenne in the mind of the composer of K. H. lay on the south
coast of England. Knowing this, we may perhaps determine, at least
approximately, the situation of Westernesse. In the Harleian and Laud
MSS., the messenger sent to seek Horn, says, _Ich seche from Westnesse
horn knight of estnesse_,” which indicates that the composer conceives
Westernesse to be west of Suddenne. Further it is very certain, as Ward
(as above, p. 449) points out, that an early version of the Horn story
has supplied several of the incidents of the _Hereward_. The influence
of the story of Horn on the _Hereward_ is particularly obvious in
chapters 4-6, where Hereward gets into trouble at the court of a king of
Cornwall named Alef, by killing a champion who had claimed the princess
in marriage; Hereward is imprisoned, but is released by the princess,
who sends him to her chosen lover, the son of a king of Ireland; a
letter subsequently reaches him, saying that she is about to be forced
into marriage with another Irish prince. Hereward reaches Cornwall
again, visits the bridal feast in disguise, and is presented with the
cup by the princess. “This,” as Ward remarks, “is certainly some
evidence that the Westnesse or Westernesse of our poem may be taken to
signify Cornwall. The name, Aylmar (_i.e._ Athelmar), also does not
oppose this view. The name was a very common one in South England, and
was borne by two of the Aldermen of Devonshire, who seem to have had
some authority over Cornwall also, one about 930, another in the early
part of the 11th century, and both bearing the epithet ‘Ailmer the
Great.’”

Another possible explanation of Westernesse may be suggested. The
duplication of names and incidents in Westernesse and Ireland has been
referred to above. The _-er_ suffix of Westernesse certainly suggests
the _-r_ termination in Westir (the name in R. H.), which is probably a
Norse name for Ireland (cf. the other Norse names in Ireland: Thurston,
Regnild, = Norse Ragnhilda, and Harild. Cf. also R. H. 2184 H, quoted
above, p. xviii), and it is not at all impossible to conceive that in
the original, simpler form of the story, there were but two scenes to
this drama, and that Westernesse of the English version, and Westir of
the Norman version, alike refer to Ireland, only that on account of the
amplification of the story, one came to think of Aylmar’s kingdom as in
England, and added a _-nesse_ to the Norse form Westir (Vestr) so as to
make the term fit a promontory on the western end of the south coast of
England, in Devonshire or in Cornwall.

    [Footnote I-9: Ward (H. L. W.), Catalogue of Romances in the
    British Museum, I, 450.]

    [Footnote I-10: Aethelwulf was King of Kent, Surrey and Sussex
    (Gaimar, 2391. Cf. also 2476, 2480-82). Aethelstan had Wessex, for
    see 2480-82. Aethelwulf was defeated by the Danes (2440-46), and
    was avenged by his brother Aethelstan, who defeated the Danes
    (2480-83).]

    [Footnote I-11: All three MSS. of K. H. say of Horn’s father,
    “_king he wes by weste_,” perhaps referring to this western
    division of the eastern kingdom. Asser visits Alfred at the
    latter’s royal ‘vill’ which is called Denne. East Dene (or Dean)
    and West Dene are two villages near Chichester. There are also two
    villages of the same name near Eastbourne.]


§ 5. STYLE.

As we have seen, the story of Horn belongs to a second growth of English
story. The manner of expression, and the general movement of the story
are quite different from those peculiar to Anglo-Saxon poetry, lacking
almost entirely the parallelism,--the appositional construction and the
heaped-up epithets, or _kennings_ of the earlier stories. With the large
French element in the vocabulary, there seems to have been introduced a
manner of expression more like the French than like the earlier English.
The movement is direct, and the imagery very simple and popular. Cf. _He
was briȝt so þe glas. He was whit so þe flur, Rose red was his colur_,
14-16, _Also blak so eny cole_, 624. _Also he sprunge of stone_, 1102,
etc. In this respect King Horn is less closely linked with the past than
is Layamon’s Brut, which was composed in the West Midlands, where the
OE. traditions in poetry persisted the longest. The Brut, while
presenting many of the modern features of manner and of phrase, still
preserves much of the manner of the past. There are in King Horn a
number of the conventionalized phrases, to be found also in Layamon
(cf. Notes to vv. 11, 67, 69, etc.), but the number of such instances is
much smaller than one would have expected, and if Layamon’s West Midland
work represents an earlier stage than King Horn in the development from
the Anglo-Saxon manner of writing, the composer of Horn has certainly
been subjected to many new and modernizing influences.

The very element in common between Layamon and King Horn is, perhaps,
the new, the modern phraseology more often than the old phraseology
rooted in the past. While, then, there are but few traces of the older
English poetic phraseology, there is much in common between King Horn
and the romances of the 13th and 14th centuries. The language in King
Horn seems to be already again crystallizing into new conventional
forms. In spite of the different demands of the metre of Horn from those
of the later, more regular, forms of versification, there are a very
great number of stereotyped phrases common to King Horn and to the
contemporary and succeeding romances composed in the other metre. I have
brought together in the Notes a number of instances of this agreement in
phraseology. The minor elements, also, are often rather mediæval than
Anglo-Saxon, and the customs described, the princess’s manner of
receiving visitors, the manner of salutation in meeting and in parting,
etc., if truly representing the manners of the time of the composition
of King Horn, soon became conventionalized and common to the whole body
of Middle English romance. (Cf. Notes to vv. 315, 319, 321, 403, 537,
739, etc.) In these respects the composer of K. H. no doubt at times
follows the conventional mode of composition of his time, but he is
probably also at times an innovator, for several scenes in Horn seem to
have been prototypes directly imitated in later romances in the
_Ipomydon_ and in the _Richard Coeur de Lion_. (Cf. Notes to 239 ff.,
264.)

On the whole, then, we see that the language of King Horn is much less
influenced, than one would expect, by older English models. The language
of the second growth of story seems to have fallen into new conventional
moulds quite independent of the older tradition.


§ 6. VERSIFICATION.

As we have seen, the phraseology of King Horn shows relatively little
trace of influence by the older English traditional stereotyped forms of
expression. In this respect if Layamon is the link connecting native
English poetry with the past, King Horn is the link joining to the newer
traditions of poetry, which were forming. For, as we have seen, if King
Horn has some phrases in common with Layamon, these are the modern forms
of expression more often than the phrases rooted in the older English
tradition. And, as we have seen, while King Horn has relatively little
of phraseology inherited from the past, it has a multitude of
stereotyped phrases in common with the poetry of contemporary and later
composition (cf. Notes). In the same way in versification, if Layamon is
the link connecting with the Anglo-Saxon mode of versification, King
Horn is the link connecting with the newer mode, of Romance or mediæval
Latin origin.

The exact theory of the versification of King Horn remains yet to be
established. Luick in his article in Paul’s Grundriss offers the very
ingenious hypothesis that in the ‘beginnings of English as well as of
German rimed verse, we have before us the coming to light again of the
primitive Teutonic measured song verse.’ This hypothesis, though
ingenious and plausible, does not admit of verification, and it is
perhaps safer to adhere to the view of Schipper (Grundriss der
englischen Metrik), who sees in Layamon’s verse the direct traditional
descendants of the OE. types, and in King Horn a further development of
the versification of Layamon.

We see then, probably, in the versification of King Horn a transitional
stage in the development of native English metre, connecting, as we have
seen, more closely with the future than with the past. It was probably
the occurrence in each verse of two syllables marked from the other
syllables by a stronger stress, that gave rise to a feeling of
uniformity in rhythm. This tendency toward uniformity in rhythm was
fostered by the regular introduction of rime, for since the riming
syllable naturally bore one of the two verse accents, and since the
riming syllables in two riming verses would occupy the same relative
position, hence in a riming verse the second of the two verse accents
must balance with that in the other verse of the pair, and the balance
established between the second pair of accents would naturally lead to a
complete balance between the two verses. In other words the two verses
would be levelled to the same rhythm.

The regular introduction of rime was, no doubt, attended by the gradual
loss of alliteration, which would cease to be significant as marking the
verse accent, since it could hardly be made to fall regularly on the
same syllable with the rime, and would hence be merely an unorganic
adornment of the verse. As the position of the two verse accents came to
be a fixed one, there seems to have been a tendency by raising some of
the syllables bearing merely a logical stress, to rhythmic importance,
thus to bring about a verse with regular measure.

The most natural products of this development are the two types: (1)
with three accents and feminine rime, the natural product of the OE. A,
D, and C metrical types, (2) with four accents and masculine rime, the
natural product of the OE. B and E types. These forms of verse were very
similar, as Schipper has pointed out (as above, § 39), to two popular
Romance forms of verse--namely: the first form, three accents with
feminine ending, to the half verses of the Alexandrine; and the second
form, four accents with masculine ending, to the verses of the short
riming couplets and to the first member of the septenar. The development
toward regular measure, which had its origin as explained above, was
furthered by the influence of the Romance and Mediæval Latin forms of
verse. In certain ME. poems, notably the _Bestiary_, there are to be
found verses constructed regularly after Romance or Mediæval Latin
models along with native forms in all the stages of development:

  1. His muð is yet wel unkuð
  Wið _pater noster_ and crede;
  Faren he norð, er fare he suð
  Leren he sal his nede.   vv. 112-15.

  2. Ðe mire muneð us
  Mete to tilen,
  Longe liuenoðe,
  ðis little wile.   vv. 273-6.
  Ðe leun stant on hille
  And he man hunten here.   vv. 1-2.

The native forms must have been influenced by this close association
with foreign forms.

To these conditions and to this course of development we must probably
attribute the origin of the versification in King Horn. The rime has
become a regular and essential element, the alliteration, a rare and
unessential element in the verse. The forms mark a transitional stage in
development, but are more closely related to the new than to the old.
There has been a half-hearted attempt to introduce regularity of
measure, but the rhythm of the OE. types has still influenced the ear of
the composer. The most frequent verse form is the one with three accents
and feminine rime, about 1300 verses (Schipper). This is developed from
the OE. through a stronger accent on one of the original theses; e.g.,
_king he was biweste so longe so hit laste_, vv. 5, 6 C, where the
measure has been developed from the OE. #A.# type through stronger
stress on _was_ and _so_ respectively. Sometimes the original OE. #A.#
type is preserved; e.g., _Hi slóȝen and fúȝten þe níȝt and þe úȝten_,
1473-4 C. But that this was not considered normal is shown by the fact
that the other two texts, #L# and #H#, have made these two verses
quoted, fit into the new normal form, by adding a new syllable in each
verse, so that we have in MS. L, _He smýten ánd he foúten þe nýȝt and
éke þe oúȝten_, vv. 1473-4 L. Cf. also H. The next most frequent type is
the one with four accents and masculine rime; e.g., _Here sone hauede to
name horn; Feyrer child ne micte ben born_, 9, 10 L. Less frequent types
are; that with three accents and masculine ending, e.g., _þu art gret
and strong, Fair and euene long_, 99-100 C; and that with four accents
and feminine rime, e.g., _To deþe he hem alle broȝte, His fader deþ wel
dere hi boȝte_, 951-2 C (but cf. #L# and #H#, which have more normal
forms).

While nearly all the verses may be made to fit into one of the types
mentioned above, there are some which do not fit naturally into any one
of the new types, but which seems rather to be a stereotyped form handed
down from OE. tradition; e.g., _Bi þe se side_ (OE. #C# type) 35, _of
alle wymmanne_ (OE. C type) 71, _Wringinde here honde_ (OE. E type) 118,
_Bi þe se brinke_ 151, _In to a galeie_ 199, _He was þe faireste_ 187 C.
(OE. #C# types). (Cf. L which tries to make this verse fit better into
the new versification, _For þat he was fayrest_), _We ben of sodenne_
189 L, _Of Cristene blode_ (OE. type E) 191 C. _And þi fairnesse_ 227 C.
_þoru out westnesse_ 228 L (MS. C adapts the verse by changing the
_westnesse_ of L. H. to _West{er}nesse_).

Compound proper names seem to have been a source of confusion. Should
both[I-12] elements of the name receive stress, primary and secondary,
as in OE., or should only one? Notice the struggles of the scribes with
verse 169: _Hy metten wiþ almair king_ C, _Metten he with aylmer king_
L, _metten hue Eylmer, þe kyng_ H. Also 257. _Ailbrus gan lere_ C, _And
aylbrous gan leren_ L, _Aþelbrus gon leren_ H. On the whole the scribes
have been fairly successful in making the native material fit into the
new forms, but not unfrequently may be detected traces of the rhythm of
the native OE. types, especially of the C type.

    [Footnote I-12: The rimes throughout indicate that the second
    syllables in compound words and the more important suffixes still
    bore an accent. Cf. 169-70, 199-200, 209-10, 219-20, 1353-4, etc.]


§ 7. DIALECT.

In what dialect King Horn was originally composed, it is not easy to
determine. This is a particularly difficult matter because the real
pronunciation is disguised behind a great diversity of written forms.
Under the circumstances the only safe guide is to be found in the rimes.
Even these are very unsatisfactory since they are too few to permit any
safe generalizations. For instance, it is impossible to apply
satisfactorily Prof. Hempl’s -wǭ-, -wō- test (cf. _Journ. of Germ.
Phil._ I, pp. 14-30). In a similar way it is impossible to apply
Pogatscher’s ingenious test by means of the shortened product of WG.
_ā_, WS. _ǣ_ (cf. _Anglia_, xxiii, pp. 301 ff.) because of want of rime
material. Another difficulty in using the rime-test is the double
pronunciation indicated, notably in the case of WS. -eald-, éa- as the
result of contraction (_e.g._ WS. _sléan_), and of words with initial
palatal ȝ- (_e.g._, WS. _geong_). Cf. examples below.

From a consideration of the phonology of the poem Wissmann concludes
(King Horn, Untersuchungen, Strassburg, 1876, p. 33) that, “Im
Allgemeinen ist der Charakter des Vocalismus ein südöstlicher, der
jedoch von dem kentischen in vielen Punkten sich unterscheidet. Die
grösste Wahrscheinlichkeit hat Essex als Gegend der Entstehung für
sich.” A further investigation reveals to me no reason for dissenting
from this view. Some of the more prominent features of the phonology are
as follows:

In all of the three MSS. the sign _æ_ has been disused. In its place
occurs, now _a_, now _e_, so that the indication of pronunciation is
often ambiguous. That the letter _a_ sometimes denotes the _æ_ sound
seems certain (cf. Wissmann, Untersuchungen, as above, p. 10). The
original pure #ă#, as in some districts of America, had nearly
disappeared, or been lengthened, or become _o_ or part of a diphthong.
The letter _a_ was thus left free to denote the _æ_ sound, though
sometimes assisted in this function by the letter _e_.

OE. _æ̆_ and OE. _ǣ_ (_ē_) shortened.

In the North and the Midland, OE. _æ̆_ and _ǣ_ (umlaut of WG. _ai_)
shortened, appear as _a_, OE. (WS.) _ǣ_ (= WG. _ā_) shortened usually as
_e_. In the West-Southern and Middle-Southern, (1) early writings have
_e_ (_æ_, _ea_), (2) later writings have _a_. In Kentish and
East-Southern the prevailing vowel is _e_. (Cf. Morsbach, §§ 96-105.)

In K. H. OE. _æ̆_ appears (1) in C usually as _a_ (one exception _bed_
536), (2) in H as _e_, e.g., _sumwet_ : _net_ 725-6, (3) in L as _a_ or
_e_. OE. _ǣ_ (i-umlaut) shortened seems to have been written the same.
Cf. 5-6, 653-4, 1249-50, with some variations from the rule in 21-2,
553-4, 1305-6, 701-2 C H. The pronunciation of this shortened OE. _ǣ_
(_i_-umlaut) seems to have been _e_. Cf. _geste_ : _feste_ 553-4,
1305-6, _biweste_ : _laste_ 5-6. Apparent evidence to the contrary are
_haste_ : _laste_ 653-4 C L (but _beste_ : _leste_ H), and _icaste_ :
_ilaste_ 701-2 C H (but _keste_ L), _hadde_ : _ladde_ 21-2, _hadde_ :
_dradde_ 1249-50 C L, but _hedde_ : _dredde_ 1249-50 H.

Note 1. OE. (WS.) _ǣ_ must have had a close pronunciation (_ẹ̄_) if we
may judge from the rimes; _here_ : _lere_ 241-2, _lede_ : _ȝede_
309-10 C, _ete_ : _suete_ 1349-50, _lere_ : _yfere_ 257-8, _swete_ :
_forlete_ 231-2, _seche_ : _speche_ 183-4, 483-4, etc. Or perhaps we
must conclude that _ẹ̄_ close and _ę̄_ open were not carefully
distinguished in rime, for cf. _stede_ : _drede_ 273-4 C, and Note 2.

Note 2. OE. _a_ when lengthened in open syllables seems to have had an
open _ę̄_ sound. Cf. _makede_ : _verade_ 179-80, _þere_ : _fare_ 497-8 L
H, _speke_ : _take_ 567-8, _þere_ : _aylmere_ 537-8 L, C H, 1613-14,
_ȝate_ : _late_ 1123-4 C, 1593-4 C, _brake_ : _gate_ 1157-8 C, _lede_ :
_made_ 1501-2 L H, _slape_ : _rape_ 1531-2 C. Cf. also the _ai_ : _ei_
rimes. L and H write _ai_, _ay_, _ei_, and _ey_ without distinction. Cf.
1087-8 L, 1361-2 C, 1399-1400, etc.

Note 3. Pogatscher’s ingenious test (_Anglia_, xxiii, 301 ff.) can not
be applied here, because, so far as I can see, there are no instances of
rimes with shortened OE. _ǣ_ (WG. _ā_). This _ǣ_ with original length
occurs in rime, now with _a_ lengthened in open syllable (cf. Note 2,
above), now with _ē_. Cf. _seche_ : _speche_ 183-4, _swete_ : _forlete_
231-2, etc.

On the whole, then, we may conclude that it is possible to assume for
K. H. the East-Southern product _e_, but that if we do so we must also
assume either inaccuracy in the rimes or a mixed dialect.

WS. _ea_ before _l_ + consonant is written, sometimes _eld_, sometimes
_old_. It seems also to have had a double pronunciation. Both
pronunciations are supported by rimes. Such rimes as _welde_ : _ȝelde_
513-14 C H, _felde_ : _welde_ 451-2 H, _bihelde_ : _felde_ 901-2,
support one pronunciation based on the OE. (WS.) breaking _ea_ before
_l_ + cons., while _Admirad_ : _bald_ C, _amyraud_ : _baud_ L,
_Admyrold_ : _bold_ H 95-6, seem to testify to the unbroken sound in OE.
lengthened before _-ld_ to _ā_ and then opened to _ǭ_. For other
instances with varying spelling cf. 17-18, 323-4, 397-8, 639-40,
1499-1500. In v. 497 the L reading _talede_ seems to represent the OE.
broken form as opposed to the unbroken form _tolde_ in #C# and #H#.

OE. _ĕ_. There are many instances of _e_ : _i_ rimes. But it is
seemingly impossible to determine thereby much concerning the dialect.
(Cf. Morsb. §§ 109, 114, N. 1.) For examples of this rime, cf. _wïlle_ :
_telle_ 383-4, 1015-16 C; _stille_ : _duelle_ 393-4 C; _þikke_ : _nekke_
1327-8; _snelle_ : _wille_ 1581-2 C, etc.

The form _sigge_ seems to belong especially to the South-East. (Morsb.
114, N. 1, 109, N. 4, also Wissman, King Horn, p. xiv.) Cf. K. H. vv.
1367-8, _ligge_ : _wiþsegge_ C, _ligge_ : _sigge_ L; _lygge_ :
_wiþsugge_ H.

OE. _ȳ̆_, umlaut of _ū̆_ offers many difficulties. It is represented in
writing by _y_, _i_, _u_, _e_. The rimes show the prevailing sound to
have been _e_; e.g., _Suddenne_ : _kenne_ 155-6, 923-4, _pelle_ :
_fulle_ 421-2, _leste_ : _beste_ 505-6, also 617-18, 671-2, 647-8,
703-4, 917-18, 919-20 L, 805-6, 795-6, 1479-80, 1637-8, 1341-2, 1367-8,
etc. But cf. _y_ : _i_ in _kesse_ : _ywisse_ 461-2 C H, _liȝte_ :
_driȝte_ 1405-6 C. That _y_ : _i_ rimes should occur, might be expected
in view of the vague distinction between _e_ and _i_ as shown by the
_e_ : _i_ rimes, but the number of _y_ : _e_ rimes attests to a
pronunciation _e_. This is the strongest available evidence that K. H.
was composed in the south-eastern district.

That the dialect of King Horn is a mixed dialect is supported by the
treatment of _æ_ above, by the double pronunciation of WS. _-eald_, and
by further double pronunciations. OE. (WS.) _slēan_, _flēan_ seem to
have had double pronunciations. The _ō_ pronunciation is attested to by
the rime, _slon_ : _vpon_ C, _slon_ : _on_ L H, 47-8. The OE. _e͞a_ is
rendered probable by the written forms, _sle_ : _fle_ 1467-8 C, etc.
Other double pronunciations are _ȝonge_ : _ispronge_ 579-80, and more
frequently the _i_ rime _ȝonge_ : _bringe_ 295-6, _ringe_ : _ȝonge_
599-600.

Prof. Hempl’s _-wǭ-_, _-wō-_ test does not yield very definite results
in this text, but seems to indicate a southern dialect. Cf. _two_ : _þo_
53-4 C, 37-8 L H, _go_ : _also_ 103-4, 107-8 L H, _wo_ : _þo_ 121-2,
279-80. But cf. _wo_ : _do_ 291-2. This might perhaps be cited as
another evidence of mixed dialect.

For consonants we have no definite rime tests, and consequently can
learn concerning them little more than the scribal preferences. In all
three texts, however, the southern forms are the favoured ones; e.g.
_ȝeue_, _ȝate_. Here again, however, we have double forms; e.g.
_wurche_ : _chirche_ 1481-2, but _werke_ : _derke_ 1547-8 C H;
_yliche_ : _riche_ 19, 20, 357-8; _ilike_ : _biswike_ 305-6, though,
perhaps, we are to seek the explanation of these double forms in
difference of vowel-ending rather than in difference of dialect.

From the inflections as from the consonants we can gain no very exact
information, and for the same reason. The evidence, however, such as it
is, points in the same direction, toward the south. The regular endings
of the present indicative seem to be _-e_, _-est_, _-eþ_ for the
singular and _-eþ_ for the plural. The forms are not numerous on account
of the infrequent use of the present tense. There are some departures
from these normal endings. _ben_ occurs occasionally in the plural of
the verb ‘be’; _e.g._ 882 L, 1643 C L, 177 H. Other traces of the
Midland ending _-en_ are to be seen, _wilen_ 2 L, 7 H, etc. Such forms
as _þou seydes_ 588 L, _þou biginnes_ 608 L, _wepes þou_ 696 L, are
probably to be explained as mistakes of the scribe of this MS., who
frequently leaves off a final consonant.

The conservative forms of the past participle, preserving the old prefix
as _i-_ or _y-_, also indicate a southern dialect for the scribes at
least.

The personal pronouns preserve the conservative southern forms, rare
exceptions being _sche_ 380 L, in place of the normal _he_, and _þei_
1557 C, _þe_ 55 L, for the normal _hi_.

From what has been said above, it seems fairly certain that the original
dialect was a southern one, and probably a south-eastern one. There are,
however, some features which distinguish the dialect of Horn from the
Kentish. (Cf. Morsbach, § 9, b.) For instance, I may cite the history of
the breaking _ea_ before _r_ + cons. In K. H. this is usually written
_a_. (Cf. 481-2, 751-2, 1147-8.) But in case of lengthening before
_-rn_, we see that the OE. broken _ea_ pronunciation must have been the
basis; e.g., _werne_ : _berne_ C L, _werne_ : _berne_ H, 753-4, 985-6,
749-50 L, 1513-14 H, _erne_ : _werne_ 937-8 H. The combinations _ē̆o_,
_ī̆o_, _ēa_ are very regularly monophthonged, not preserving any of the
Kentish diversity of form.

The time of composition must have been fairly late, as we must infer
from the number of French words even in the rimes. That K. H. was
composed later than the beginning of the 13th century, we may conclude
from the fact that OE. _ā_ has been regularly converted into _-ǭ-_. Cf.
_drof_ : _of_ 129-30, _forsoke_ : _loke_ 799-800, etc. That it was
composed in the second half of the century seems certain from the
regularity of the conversion of _ā_ to _ǭ-_, and further from the
lengthening of short vowels in open syllables. Of this latter phenomenon
we have very few certain instances. Such rimes, however, as _þere_ :
_fare_ 497-8 L H and _stede_ : _drede_ 273-4 C, seem to be certain
enough. (Cf. also 179-80, 537-8, 567-8, 1123-4 C, 1157-8 C, 1501-2 L H,
1531-2 C, 1613-14.)


§ 8. MANUSCRIPTS.

The English story of King Horn is preserved in three MSS.

1. The Cambridge University MS. Gg. 4. 27, 2, which forms the nucleus of
the present volume, is merely a fragment of fourteen folios. It contains
on its first folios the latter part of the story of Floris and
Blauncheflur, which is printed in the present volume. This is followed
by King Horn entire, which is followed by the fragment, printed in this
volume, of the Assumption.

The Cambridge MS. is written in a very plain book-hand, apparently of
the latter half of the 13th century. The folios are written in double
columns, and occasionally, since the lines are short, two lines are
joined in one. The initial letters are written a little apart from the
rest, and are marked with strokes of red.

This text of King Horn is the one printed by Lumby in the first edition
of the present volume.

2. Laud Misc. MS. 108 is well known because containing one of the
earliest collections of legends. It contains sixty-one legends (the
Southern Cycle) followed by three religious poems, these in turn
followed by the romances of Havelok and Horn, and these followed by
three further legends, in a later hand of the 15th century.

The MS. is written in double columns on parchment, and probably dates
back to 1325. The texts of Horn and Havelok are written in a fine
book-hand. The lives that are appended are written in a later, much less
formal hand.

[For full description of the MS. and its contents, see C. Horstmann,
Altenglische Legenden, pp. x-xii, Paderborn, 1875.]

This text of King Horn is printed by C. Horstmann in Herrig’s Archiv,
1872, pp. 39-58.

3. Harleian MS. 2253 is well known to all connoisseurs of early lyric
poetry. It seems to be the collection of a genuine lover of poetry. In
the words of the Brit. Mus. Catalogue it is, “A parchment book in small
folio, written by several hands, upon several subjects; partly in old
French, partly in Latin, and partly in old English; partly in prose,
partly in verse.” The lyrical poems have been reprinted by T. Wright
(Specimens of Lyric Poetry, Percy Society, London, 1842), who believes
that the collection had its origin in the Abbey of Leominster in
Herefordshire. The English poems have also been published by Dr. K.
Böddeker (Altenglische Dichtungen des MS. Harl. 2253. Berlin, 1878).

The MS. is written in an informal, but legible hand, probably of the
early 14th century. The writer of the text of King Horn seems to have
been acquainted with the French version of the story, as we must infer
from his substitution of Allof (R. H. aaluf) for Murry. The word _geste_
in the heading, and the French orthography throughout, together with
occasional forms as _enimis_ 1024 H, nom. sing. of enemy (cf. Note),
659 H, _maister_ gen. sing., 123 L, Horns, nom. sing. go along with the
evidence of the French associations of the MS., to make us believe that
the scribe was an Anglo-Norman.

This text of King Horn has been printed by J. Ritson (Anc. Engl. Metr.
Rom., London, 1882, II, pp. 91-155).

We thus see that for the preservation of King Horn we are indebted to
(1) a fragment of a collection of stories, (2) a southern collection of
legends, to which have been appended Havelok and Horn, (3) a genuine
literary collection probably made in Herefordshire by an Anglo-Norman.

Of these MSS. no one is derived from either of the others. To indicate
their interrelations, I will borrow the diagram of Wissmann expressing
the result of his studies in this matter. (Cf. Wissmann, King Horn, p.
v, Strassburg, 1881.)

§ 1. INTRODUCTORY.

If in King Horn we have a story Germanic in descent, and betraying
everywhere traces of its Germanic origin, in Floris and Blauncheflur we
have a romance of extraneous, probably ultimately of oriental origin,
and the contrast is in many ways interesting and instructive. The love
element, which in King Horn plays so large a part, in Fl. and Bl. is the
all in all. This story of all-absorbing passion, which in spite of
seemingly insurmountable obstacles and desperate perils, in the end
reunites the devoted lovers, was one of the most popular during the
Middle Ages, and one of the earliest to be imported from the East. The
history of the tale vies in interest with the story itself. The story in
a perplexing variety of versions spread over all the countries of
Christendom, as we shall see later. It seems to be the basis of the
charming _chantefable_, Aucassin and Nicolete, which Andrew Lang and
Walter Pater have made so well known to the modern world. The English
version, which unfortunately is incomplete at the beginning in each one
of the four manuscripts in which it has been written down, was probably
derived directly from one of the French versions, as we shall see.


§ 2. HISTORY.

_(a) Origin._

The story of Floris and Blauncheflur is probably an oriental product,
and shows many traces of Byzantine influence. It was one of the first of
these oriental tales to be retailed in the Occident and had a wide
circulation in all the countries of western Christendom, from Spain and
Italy to the Scandinavian North. Its route from East to West it is not
easy to trace with certainty, though the Crusades were quite probably
the means of its importation. Further than this it is not easy to
determine. The Provençals, whose active part in the Crusades is well
known, may have been the agents, or, as is so often the case with the
oriental tales, it may have been imported in a Latin dress.

The history of the story in the West is complicated on account of the
puzzling multiplicity of versions among which it is sometimes
exceedingly difficult to determine the interrelations. The clue to the
difficulty was early hinted at by Sommer (E. Sommer, Einl. zu R. Fleckes
Flore und Blaunscheflur, Quedlingburg und Leipzig, 1846), and more
recently the matter has been very thoroughly explained by Herzog
(H. Herzog, Die beiden Sagenkreise von Flore und Blanscheflur, Wien,
1884) in his investigation of the subject. Herzog points out that there
are to be distinguished in the Occident, two distinct general versions
of the story. In the first of these, #A#, seems to be preserved the
story in its original and genuine form. The second of these versions,
#B#, seems to be a remodelling of the original version in the attempt to
adapt to common folk a story in its existing form intended for higher
circles of society.[I-13] For this purpose slight allusions in #A#, are
expanded in #B# into striking incidents. To bring out into strong light
the injustice of Floris’s father and the final triumph of true love,
supernatural and horrible elements and episodes are introduced. Since
these new elements are of a kind common in other Byzantine tales, it is
concluded that the remodelling of the story had already taken place
before the importation from the East.

The second of these imported versions, #B#, first circulated in Italy,
in Spain and in Greece. It also seems, somewhat indirectly as we shall
see, to have served as a basis for the second French version and for one
group of the German _Volksbücher_. The versions of #B#, if we leave the
second French version out of consideration, all represent the parents of
Blauncheflur as Italian, and in part have the same names for the
characters. This circumstance, with other corroborating facts, seems to
indicate that version #B# first took root in Italy, and from there
spread into Spain and into Greece, possibly its original home.

Version #A#, on the other hand, seems first to have been imported into
France, the great jobbing nation of the Middle Ages in all sorts of
romantic stuffs and materials. From France it was early retailed to
Germany, to England, to Scandinavia, and, possibly, to Italy. From
Germany in turn it was re-exported into Bohemia. Version #A# was without
doubt the first to become known, since we find it not only in the Old
French, but in the Germanic versions springing from a French source, in
an unperverted state. All the different versions of #B#, on the other
hand, have been very noticeably influenced by #A#, indicating that the
arrival of #B# was after #A# had become established and well known.


_(b) In France._

We encounter the story of _Floris and Blauncheflur_ earliest in France,
and the French seem to have been the first to make the story a subject
for poetic treatment. The story appears in French, besides in two songs
celebrating episodes in this tale of true love, in two distinct
versions. The earliest of these versions, which we may designate as I.,
had its origin, it seems, about 1160.[I-14] (Cf. F. Steinmeyer, H Z,
xxi, 319.) Certain it is that a French version of #A# must have existed
about 1170, to serve as a basis for one of the German (the low Rhenish)
versions, Floyris und Blanscheflur. This French version, #I#, seems to
represent fairly well the #A# general form of the story. As so often in
the case of other romances, the _jongleurs_ tried to bring this foreign
importation into the cycle of French story by connecting in bonds of
kinship, its characters with the names celebrated in French epic.
Blauncheflur is represented as being the mother of Bertha of the big
foot, the wife of Pepin, father of Charlemagne.[I-15]

Du Méril (E. du Méril, Floire et Blancheflor, Paris, 1876) in discussing
the interrelations of the two French versions, characterizes one as a
version for a select public, “_version aristocratique_,” and the second
as a version for the entertainment of the masses, “_version populaire_.”
The French II. version, the “_version populaire_,” is, according to
Herzog, p. 4, the result of a sort of fusion of the #A# and #B# general
forms of the story,[I-16] with which have been woven in various episodes
which elsewhere are not known to either general form of the story, #A#
or #B#. Herzog further on continues (p. 11), “Ich halte dafür dass
dieselbe (the OF. II. version) ebenfalls aus Italien nach Frankreich
hinübergewandert ist, wo ihr Bearbeiter den Inhalt des zweiten Kreises
mit dem ihm geläufigen ersten Kreise so verschmolzen hat, dass dieser
einige nur dem zweiten Sagenkreise angehörige Züge ganz verdrängte.”

The general style and manner of handling the story is quite different in
the two French versions. The “_version aristocratique_” preserves the
traits of an oriental romance, and Floire is represented as a love-sick
youth. “_Sans li ne puis jou pas aprendre_” he replies when his father
proposes to educate him alone. There is hardly a more sentimental
passage in literature than the one in I. (212-266) describing the
school-days of the children:

  _Ensamble vont, ensamble vienent
  Et la joie d’amor maintient
  Nus d’aus deus chose ne savoit
  Que lués a l’autre ne disoit.
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  On ooient parler d’amors.
  Ensamble lisent et aprendent;
  A la joie d’amor entendent:
  Un vergier a li peres Floire
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  D’amors i chantent li oisel.
  Quant il mangoient et bevoient
  Li oisel seure aus se séoient;
  Des oiseles oent les chans:
  Cou est la vie as deus enfans.
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  Et quant a l’escole venoient
  Lor tables d’yvoire prenoient,
  Adont lor veissiez escrire
  Letres et vers d’amors en cire.
  Letres et salus font d’amors
  Du chant des oisiaus et des flors._

The writer of I. is evidently a genuine poet, though perhaps somewhat of
the ‘spring poet’ order. He exalts the sentiment of love, as we have
seen, and feelingly describes the elaborately constructed tomb
(vv. 530-652), the finely wrought cup (vv. 431-498), and the birds and
flowers and fountains and trees of the gardens of the king and of the
‘Admiral.’ He dwells in sensuous fondness in his enumeration equally of
the fine stuffs and precious stones; the _mantiaus_, _vairs osterins_
and _bliaus indes porprins_ (429-30), or the _saffirs_ and _calcidoines_
and _boines jagonses_ and _sardoines_, etc. (1755-77), and of flowers
and trees; the “_poivre, canele et garingal_,” or the “_encens, girofle
et citoval_,” or the _beuns_, the _plantoine_, the _alïer_, the _boins
figiers_, the _peschiers_, the _periers_ and the _noiers_ (1761-8).

The “_version populaire_,” on the other hand, seems to be adapted
somewhat to the ideal of the native French epic, and Floire is
represented as a model of courage and knightly virtue, in a class with
the _douze pers_ and the other heroes of the Charlemagne cycle of
stories. The writer interpolates scenes in which Floire may display his
fighting qualities. In the early part of the story, he returns from
school just in time to rescue Blauncheflur, who is about to be committed
to the flames. He accomplishes her rescue by acting as her champion and
fighting the seneschal, who has accused her of attempting to poison the
king. The combat is a stirring one quite in the manner of the _Chansons
de geste_ (vv. 920-1160). On the journey to Babylon, Floire has heroic
adventures in a battle with Diogenes, son of Samones, king of the city
of Fusis (1854-1984). Later, when the trial of Fl. and Bl. is
interrupted by the arrival of an invader, Jonas de Handreas, Fl. offers
to vanquish the invaders if his life be spared. At first he is
unsuccessful in his attempt, but after being taken prisoner by the
invaders, he is aroused by the reproachful words of Bl. and breaking
loose, slays Jonas, thus delivering the city and winning Bl.
(3120-3410). The writer of II. emphasizes the battle scenes at the
expense of the descriptive passages, devoting to the description of the
tomb only 32 verses, and to that of the wonderful cup, only 14. He seems
also to be of a practical turn of mind, and instead of fondly
enumerating the gems received for Bl., describes rather the
circumstances of the sale. Babyloine is a rich city with no poor, and
has a rent of three thousand ounces of gold each day (vv. 2319, 2342).
From all these instances one can see that the sweet and sentimental tale
of the I. version is quite modified in II. If we agree with Herzog that
this version was the result of the blending of the #B# version imported
from Italy, with the #A# version, which was already well known in
France, we must conclude also that this “_version populaire_” is
influenced by the ideals of contemporary French poetry of native origin,
by the manners and conventions of the _chansons de geste_, and the
heroic romances springing from or influenced by them.


_(c) Provence._

Among the troubadours of Provence the story of Fl. and Bl. was early
known and popular, as one must judge from the very frequent allusions.
There is, however, no proof of the existence of a Provençal romance.


_(d) In Germany._

In Germany are to be encountered many versions of the popular story. The
earliest one seems to have been the Low Rhenish poem Floyris and
Blaunchiflur, of about 3700 lines, translated by an unknown poet about
1170 (Steinmeyer, H. Z. xxi, 307-331). To the middle of the 13th century
belongs the MHG. poem in 8006 lines by Konrad Fleck, composed, quite
independently of the Low Rhenish version above mentioned, after an OF.
original. (Ed. by E. Sommer, Quedlingburg u. Leipzig, 1846.) Somewhat
younger is the Mid. Low Germ. poem, _Floris ende Blancefloer_ of 3983
lines (Ed. by H. von Fallensleben, Leipzig, 1836, and by H. E. Moltzer,
Groningen, 1879, in the _Bibl. van Middelnederlands Letterkunde_). The
poet, Dideric van Assenede, says, himself, that he derived his material
from the “Walsche.”[I-17] As a matter of fact his original seems to have
been French. To the third half of the 14th century belongs the Low Germ.
poem _Flosse un Blankflosse_ of 1534 lines (Ed. by Stephan Waetzoldt,
Bremen, 1880), which also seems to go back to a French original.[I-18]

If we look more closely into the question of the French original of the
German poems, we must assume a version, χ, earlier than the version
preserved in the three existing MSS. of French I. version. These three
MSS. may be classed into a group, _z_, whose chief characteristic is the
attempted suicide of Floris in the Lion pit. This scene appears in two
of the existing MSS., and the writer of the third MS. seems to have had
the scene in his original but to have left it out. (Cf. H. Sundmacher,
_Die altfrz. u. mittelhd. Bearbeitung der Sage von Fl. und Bl._, diss.
Göttingen, 1872.) Among the German versions it appears only in the LG.
_Flosse un Blankflosse_. The other German versions must rest on an OF.
version, χ, which at the hands of Fleck[I-19] underwent an artistic
reconstruction, but at the hands of Dideric was translated simply,
without the addition of any new ideas by the adapter.

In addition to these early German versions must be mentioned two groups
of _Volksbücher_: (1) from Boccaccio’s Filocolo, (2) from Fleck’s poem,
also a Bohemian adaptation and a German Jewish adaptation,
(Cf. Hausknecht, ed. of Fl. u. Bl., pp. 13-20, Berlin, 1885.)


_(e) In Scandinavia._

Our story had a wide circulation also in the North, as one must infer
from the number of Scandinavian versions preserved: (1) the old Norweg.
fragment of a saga (ed. by G. Storm, _Nordisk Tidskrift for Filologi og
Pædagogik_, Copenhagen, 1874, pp. 24-28), (2) the complete Icelandic
saga of _Flóres ok Blankiflúr_, (3) the fragments of a second Icelandic
Saga (ed. by Brynjolf Snorrason, _Annaler for nordisk old kyndighed og
historie_, 1850); (4) the Old Swed. poem (ed. by E. Klemming, _Samlingar
utgifna af svenska formskrift-sällskapet_, I., Stockholm, 1844); and (5)
the Danish translations from the Swedish (ed. by C. J. Brandt,
_Romantisk Digtning fra Middelalderen_, I. and II. København, 1869-77).
The distinguishing characteristic of the Northern versions is the
conclusion. According to the Norse version, Floris, to refute the charge
that he has gained admittance to Bl.’s tower by the use of magic tricks,
offers to fight in single combat the bravest of the Admiral’s knights.
In the ensuing combat he overcomes the Admiral’s champion, and receives
as his guerdon, Blauncheflur. If we accept Herzog’s conclusions (pp. 15,
35, 45-6, 66) we must assume as an original for the Scandinavian
versions, a French original, N, with the ending peculiar to the Northern
versions. The development from this original is shown by the following
plan (also borrowed from Herzog, p. 92).

_(f) In Italy._

In Italy also the story of Fl. and Bl. enjoyed great popularity. The two
chief versions were: (1) the _Cantare_, written by a popular poet in
_ottave rime_; and (2) Boccaccio’s youthful production, his first prose
romance, _Filocolo_. That the I. version of the story, the one most
popular in France, was also current in Italy, we see in these two
versions, both of which show, in addition to the special traits of II.,
many traits peculiar to version I. To determine exactly the
interrelations of these two versions is no easy matter. From allusions
in the _Filocolo_ we know that the _Cantare_ was the older. Internal
evidence, however, forbids the supposition that the _Filocolo_ has
sprung from the _Cantare_. Rather the two versions go back to a common
source. This Italian, or Franco-Italian, version, which probably had no
differences of real moment from the _Cantare_ in its present form, must
in many points have been more ample and complete, and in individual
instances nearer the French tradition, than the _Cantare_ is.

In connection with the Italian group must also be mentioned the Greek
poem of Florios and Platziaflore, composed in the 14th century and
founded upon the _Cantare_.


_(g) In Spain._

In Spain we find allusion to our story already in the 13th century, when
the _Gran conquista de Vltramar_ refers to Fl. and Bl. as the most
devoted pair of lovers that one had ever heard of. But there is no proof
of the existence of a Spanish version of the story as early as this. In
the year 1512, appeared at Alcala the prose romance, _Flores y
Blancaflor_, which is current to the present day. The close relationship
of this to the Italian versions is very evident. Its source, however,
seems hardly to be directly the _Cantare_. The beginning of the Spanish
romance, which is entirely peculiar to this version, points rather to a
version in the North of Italy, which the Spanish adapter has quite
probably translated into Spanish without important alteration.

    [Footnote I-13: G. Paris distinguishes three general versions, two
    French versions and a third, “Roman” version, in which the parents
    of Blauncheflur are not French but Roman.]

    [Footnote I-14: The evidence cited by G. Paris, consists of
    allusions to--(1) History of Troy, (2) Siege of Troy, (3) Aeneid,
    etc. The place of origin, according to G. Paris, was probably in
    the region about Beauvais, lying between Normandy, Picardy and the
    Île de France.]

    [Footnote I-15: Perhaps this is a mere coincidence, since in a
    poem about Berthe, her father happens to be named ‘Florie,’ a
    Florie with a different history, _roi de Hongrie_. Later this
    relationship was commonly assumed. In the _Gran Conquista de
    Vltramar_, the story of Berthe is intercalated. She is daughter of
    Blancaflor and Flores.]

    [Footnote I-16: G. Paris makes this II. version the sole
    representative of a third distinct form of the story, the 2^o of
    his general classification, 1^o, 2^o, 3^o.]

    [Footnote I-17: That is to say, French or Italian.]

    [Footnote I-18: This version was evidently not translated from a
    French MS. but written from memory. The details are not always
    exactly identical with those of the French, though often so,
    enough so to make the origin of the poem unmistakable though it is
    much condensed and the order of events somewhat transposed.]

    [Footnote I-19: Fleck’s work is a paraphrase. The details are
    identical but are amplified to 8006 verses.]


§ 3. ENGLISH VERSION.

The story of Fl. and Bl. found its way into England in the 13th century,
that is to say, when it had been for a hundred years familiar to French
hearers and after it had already spread into many lands outside of
France. As has been said, the English version goes back to a French
original. This original was certainly of the I. form. Of the features
peculiar to the French II. version, the English version does not show
one, while it agrees with the French I. version to the extent of exact
translation of many phrases and verses and even of reproduction of
French rime-words. At the same time the French original that lay before
the English adapter can not have been the text exactly as it is
preserved in any one of the three extant French MSS., but rather an
older, or purer text which we have designated by χ, a distinguishing
feature of which is the absence of the attempted suicide of Floris in
the lion pit. The text that must be assumed as the original of the
English poem must have been very similar to the original from which
Fleck and Dideric derived their German versions, but not exactly
identical as is evidenced by frequent slight divergences.

The English poet has not expanded and amplified by the addition of
further details or by the introduction of personal reflections, as the
German Fleck has done. He has presented the essential features of the
love story as it impressed him, in a condensed form to be sure, at the
same time without bareness or baldness. Unlike the adapter of the Low
Rhenish condensed version, he has preserved the original order of
incidents, and has usually preserved faithfully the smallest details
that have any essential bearing on the plot.

Some idea of the English writer’s fidelity to the details and even to
the phraseology of his French original, and of his method of
translating, may be gained from the following parallel passages:

  _Que bien sorent parler latin_
  _Et bien escrivre en parchemin_
          vv. 263-4.

    _Inouȝ þey couþ of latyne_
    _And wel wryte on parchemyn_
            vv. 33-4.

  _Ja li ferai le chief couper._
          vv. 399-400.

    _Let do bryng forþ þat mayde,_
    _Fro þe body þe heved schal goo._
            vv. 140-41.

  _Qu’a fin or l’a sept fois pesée._
          vv. 507-8.

  _Ci gist la bele Blanceflor_
  _A cui Floires ot grant amor._
          vv. 651-2.

    _Here liþ swete Blauncheflur_
    _Þat Floris loved par amur._

    _And to his herte hit hadde ismite,_
    _Nadde his moder hit underȝite._
            vv. 308-10.

The _grafe_ is elaborately described in vv. 788-98:

  _Li roi li done un palefroi,_
  _Qui d’une part estoit tous blans,_
  _De l’autre rouges comme sans._
          vv. 964-6.

    _Þe king let sadel a palfray_
    _Þe oon half white, so mylke_
    _And þat oþer reed, so sylk._
            vv. 382-4.

  _Fius, fait ele, gardez le bien;_
  _Tant com l’aurez, mar _cremez_ rien;_
  _Car vous ja rien ne requer(r)iez_
  _Que tost ou tard vous ne l’aiez_
          vv. 1003-6.

    _Mi sone, he rede, have þis ring;_
    _While he is þin, ne dute noþing._
      .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

    _To þi wil þu schalt habbe whate._
            vv. 393-8.

    _Hi beden God ȝive him wel fin_
    _Þat so manie flures dide þerin_
            vv. 855-6.

  _Des flors sali un paveillon_
  _Des eles feri mon menton;_
  _Del paveillon tel paor oi,_
  _Que m’escriai plus tost que poi_
          vv. 2093-6.

    _Þer fliste ut a buterfliȝe,_
    _Are ihc wiste, on mine iȝe._
    _So sore ihc uas offerd of þan,_
    _Þat ihc loude crie bigan_
            vv. 889-92.

  _Bele compaigne, Blanceflor,_
  _Volez vous veoir bele flor?_
          vv. 2117-18.

    _And sede, “Swete Blauncheflur,_
    _Wiltu se a wel fair flur?”_
            vv. 897-8.

  _Damoisele qui a amor_
  _Et joie en soi, doit avoir flor._
          vv. 2124-30.

    _Ho þat loveþ par amur,_
    _An haþ þerof joie, mai love flur._
            vv. 903-4.

In spite of this number of tolerably exact correspondences, in word and
phrase, with the French original, the English poem is a condensed
adaptation rather than a slavish translation. As in the French II.
version, the tender and sentimental element is much condensed; but the
English writer, unlike the writer of French II., does not introduce the
heroic and warlike element in the form of duels and battles. He does not
amplify by adding new details, as Fleck did, nor does he confuse the
order of incidents as does the adapter of the Low Rhenish version. He
makes rather a faithful condensation quite after the manner of English
adapters from the French, which is no doubt to be explained as due not
so much to difference between the writers, English and French, as to a
difference between the hearing publics, French and English, for whom the
production was intended.[I-20]

No doubt with his English public in mind, the English poet, in adapting
the story from the French, has modified to some extent the tenderness
and sentimentality, even at times the poetic descriptions, of his French
original (compare vv. 1117-1194 of the French with the corresponding
English vv. 457-72), and has omitted the enumeration of gems and of
precious stuffs suggestive of an elegance perhaps unintelligible to an
English speaking and hearing public at this time. The wonderful cup, to
the description of which 67 verses (431-498) are devoted in the French
romance, in the English poem is dismissed with 17 verses (163-184). The
garden so elaborately described in the French, vv. 1724-1835, in the
English poem occupies only vv. 685-732. The description of the knife
(_grafe_), which serves no other purpose than that of external adornment
in the French version (vv. 788-799), is entirely neglected in the
English translation. The translator’s method is well illustrated in the
case of the description of Floris’s equipage preliminary to setting out
on his journey. The description of the saddle and harness occupies 37
verses (964-1000) of the French poem, and is dismissed by the English
translator with 5 (vv. 382-389), _I ne can telle ȝou noȝt Hu richeliche
þe sadel was wroȝt_, and three verses following.

To sum up, the English version is a free, somewhat condensed,
translation from the French I. version. The translator has introduced
almost no new traits, and the extent of the condensation may be judged
by considering the 1296 verses of the English as compared with the 2974
verses in the French I. version. The manner of the condensation has been
indicated. But with all the condensation, especially in the descriptive
passages, it is important to note that in the essential features of the
story, the translator follows his original faithfully, so that the main
outline of the story is preserved as accurately in English as in French.

    [Footnote I-20: This same consideration, as we have seen, probably
    explains _in part_ the difference between the English King Horn
    and the Norman French _Horn et Rigmenil_.]


§ 4. DIALECT.

In Fl. and Bl. as in King Horn it is difficult to distinguish certain
criteria of dialect on account of the variety of orthography in the
different manuscripts. Here again the only safe guide is the rimes, and
the evidence of these is not entirely uniform for the different texts.
There is a great difference in age between MS. C, the oldest, and MS. T,
probably the youngest of the four MSS. Further there is a difference in
the dialects represented by the different scribes. The scribes of MSS. C
and Cott. were evidently southerners, and seem, here and there, to have
twisted the verses around to make them fit the Southern dialect. On the
other hand the later scribe of MS. T seems to have changed verses to
make them fit his later dialect. Either the phrases are less stereotyped
than in Horn or the poem was not so well known; in any event the scribes
of the individual texts seem to have allowed themselves greater
independence. The result is that the rime test here is not a sure one.
The evidence of rimes in MS. C is not necessarily valid for MS. T, and
_vice versā_; and which rimes indicate the pronunciation of the original
composer, it is often difficult to say. If we bear these points in mind
we may perhaps draw some satisfactory conclusions from the following
criteria:

1. OE. _ȳ̆_ seems to have been pronounced _ī̆_. e.g.; _cusseþ_ :
_blisse_, _custe_ : _wiste_ 549-52 C, _ywys_ : _kysse_ 1067 T, _winne_ :
_kinne_ 806 C, _blisse_ : _kisse_ 786 C, _fylle_ : _wylle_ 738 T,
_lyke_ : _lyte_ 782 T. Only apparent exceptions are _meene_ : _kyne_
274 T (these words do not rime together in the original), and _bygge_ :
_segge_ 989 T. _Ostesse_ : _kysse_ belongs only to MSS. T and Auch.

2. If we apply Prof. Hempl’s _-wǭ-_, _-wọ̄-_ test we find some evidence
of a Midland dialect, e.g.; _too_ : _soo_ 94 T, _vndoo_ : _soo_ 74 T,
_also_ : _doo_ 224 T, 764 C, _soo_ : _doo_ 64 T, 336 T, 624 T, _so_ :
_fordo_ 307-8 C. This test applied to Fl. and Bl. is not certain in
itself, but supports the other evidence. That the test is uncertain we
see from the occurrence of apparently inaccurate rimes such as _hoom_ :
_doom_ 1079 T, 802 C, and from a few rimes which oppose the evidence of
those above cited, e.g., _þoo_ : _twoo_ 30 T, _two_ : _mo_ 218 T (and
Cott.), _so_ : _go_ 438 C, 824 C, _bo_ : _atuo_ 548 C, 614 C, _þo_ :
_so_ 666 C, _also_ : _bo_ 780 C, _whoom_ : _froom_ 70 T. It would seem
then that the change had affected the _ā_ in OE. _swā_ but not in _twā_
and _hwā_. It must be noted that all the quoted _so_ rimes with _ọ̄_
occur in MS. C, which, as we shall see later, has a strong Southern
colouring.

3. The product of OE. _a_ before _l_ + cons. seems to be _a_, or with
lengthening before _-ed_, _ō_. e.g.; _wal_ : _cristal_ 273-4 C (also
609-10 T), _wolde_ : _golde_ 208 T, _tolde_ : _holde_, _sholde_ :
_holde_ 435-6 T (also 77-80 C), _wolde_ : _beholde_ 751 T (also
449-50 C), 769-70 T (also 471-2 C). Exceptions occur in the Southern
MSS. e.g.; _elde_ : _helde_ 102 Cott., _halle_ : _welle_ 230 C,
_welle_ : _alle_ 224 C, 280 C, but are not paralleled in MS. T.[I-21]

4. The inflectional endings of the pres. indic. seem to be _-e_, _-est_,
_-eþ_ for the singular. There are rimes to prove the 3rd sing. in _-eþ_;
_seith_ : _withe_ 106 T, _he sit_ : _nabit_ 40 C, _geþ_ : _deþ_ 200 C
(also T and Cott.), 422 C (also T). The plural ending is less evident.
The Cambr. MS. has rcularly _-eþ_. e.g.; _habbeþ_ 20, _serueþ_ 1256,
_beoþ_ 294, 295, _weneþ_ 314, _leteȝ_ 448, _chaungeþ_ 510, _goþ_,
_seoþ_, _spekeþ_ 708 C, _crieþ_ 526; the T. MS. _-en_, e.g.; _seruen_
590 T, _cryen_ 815 T, _ben_ 909 T, etc. That the _-eþ_ ending did not
belong to the original we may probably infer from the fact that while
the _-eþ_ of the 3rd sing. counts metrically, the _-eþ_ of the plural
usually does not. Cf. 20 C, 256 C, 448 C, 526 C, 708 C, etc. But cf.
_springeþ_ 296 C, _bisecheþ_ 765 C, _falleþ_ 786 C. These endings, then,
point to an East Midland dialect. Cf. also the rimes; _wepinge_ :
_bringe_ Cott. p. 105, _cusseþ_ : _blisse_ 549-50 C.

5. OE. _æ̆_ (_e_) and shortened OE. _ǣ_, umlaut of WG. _ai_, or WG. _ā_.

The OE. short _æ_ appears regularly as _a_. _trespas_ : _was_ 1043 T,
_orgas_ : _was_ 102 T, _Cesar_ : _bar_ 182 T, are probably to be
explained as due to one of the Southern scribes of MSS. C and Cott. e.g.
_vnderȝet_ : _set_ 166 C (but cf. _vnderȝat_ : _sat_ 98 C). The
shortening of OE. _ǣ_ (umlaut of WG. _ai_) also appears regularly as
_a_. e.g.; _glade_ : _ladde_ 480 T, _ilast_ : _cast_ 338 C, _glad_ :
_ilad_ 114 C. But cf. _lasse_ : _wytnesse_ 952 T. In the rime, _rest_ :
_mest_ 120 C, 384 C, it is impossible to determine whether the _ǣ_ is
shortened to _ĕ_, as in parts of the South, or the _ĕ_ is lengthened to
_ē_. The shortening of OE. _ǣ_ (WG. _ā_) does not occur in rime often
enough to permit any safe conclusion. The rimes _radde_ : _madde_ 826 T
and _radde_ : _hadde_ 1025 T, seem to show that the product of
shortening was _a_. That the representative of WG. _ā_ was the Saxon _ǣ_
rather than the Anglian, and Kentish _ē_, seems probable from the rimes
_rede_ : _seide_ 21-2 T, 51-2 T, 215-16 T, 263-4 T (66 Cott.); _reede_ :
_deede_ 45-6 T, 53-4 T.

From these criteria, which seem to be the best available, we may infer
that Fl. and Bl. belongs further north than King Horn. Further, the
inflections seem to point to the Eastern rather than to the Western
Midland, so that we may feel fairly safe in attributing Fl. and Bl. to
the East Midland.

    [Footnote I-21: That the Cambr. scribe was from the South is very
    apparent from: (1) the pres. indic. plur. endings in eþ, e.g.
    _comeþ_ 282, etc., (2) the above rimes of OE. _call_ : _ell_, (3)
    _axede_ 576, 602, etc., (4) _rede_ : _hadde_ 453-4, (5) _hi_ for
    ‘they’ 284, etc., _heo_ for ‘she’ 303, etc., (6) _ifere_ 502 C, in
    fere 827, 280 T, (7) _vaire_ 16, _wuder_ 114, etc.]


§ 5. DATE OF COMPOSITION.

We shall probably be safe in setting the date of composition in the
second half of the 13th century. Lengthening in open syllables seems to
have taken place, e.g.; _coome_ : _soone_ 100 T, _grome_ : _coome_
112 T, _come_ : _hoome_ 500 T, _wite_ : _vnderȝete_ 556 C (also Cott.),
_wite_ : _wite_ 756 C, _þerone_ : _stone_, 112 T, _vppone_ : _stone_
172 T, 212 T, _þare_ : _ware_ 1036 T, etc. From this we must conclude
that the date of composition is not earlier than 1250. On the other hand
the earliest MS. (C) dates back to the second half of the 13th century.
Indeed in this MS. there are still traces of the old distinction of
grammatical gender, and OE. _ū_ is still always represented by _u_;
while the second oldest MS. (Cott.) has the newer writing _ou_.
(Cf. Hausknecht, ed. of Fl. and Bl. p. 130, Berlin, 1885.)


§ 6. VERSIFICATION.

The poem is composed in short rimed couplets. The normal verse has four
stresses. In no one of the MSS., however, are all the verses perfectly
regular, due largely, no doubt, in part to the variety of forms
available to each composer and to the variety of spellings to choose
from, also to the attempts of each scribe to make the verses of the
original fit into his own dialect. The rimes may be masculine or
feminine. At times they are mere assonances, e.g.; _first_ : _lyst_
693-4, _furste_ : _luste_ 377-8 C, _lyke_ : _lyte_ 781-2 T, _longe_ :
_sonde_ 795-6 C, _coome_ : _soone_ 100 T, etc. At times they are
inaccurate, e.g.; _grunde_ : _honde_ 303-4 C, _meene_ : _kyne_ 273-4 T.
Peculiar are the rimes; _þerate_ : _gate_ 153-4 C, etc., _fyne_ :
_þeryne_ 369-70 T, 441-2 C, etc., _þerone_ : _stone_ 112 T, 212 T.


§ 7. MANUSCRIPTS.

Floris and Blauncheflur appears in four MSS., in each of the four with a
greater or smaller part of the beginning lost.

1. #T.#, the Trentham MS., is in the library of the Duke of Sutherland
at Trentham Hall in Staffordshire. The MS. is a relatively late one
(about 1440), and is written in a very legible, informal running hand,
with loops to the _b_’s, _l_’s, etc. It contains a series of metrical
romances; besides Floris and Blauncheflur, also Kyng Rychard, Bevous of
Hampton, The Batell of Troye, Amys and Amylion, and Sir Eglamoure. Our
poem stands on folios 98-111. The headings to the pages are; on the
even, left-hand pages, _Florence_, on the odd, right-hand pages, _&
Blanchefloure_. The MS. contains 1083 lines of our poem. The beginning
of the poem is lost in this MS., as in the three others, and the first
preserved folio is an odd, right-hand page, with the heading, _&
Blanchefloure_. The first verse in this MS. corresponds to verse 193 of
the French.

The reading of the MS. is made difficult and uncertain by the end
flourishes to certain letters, e.g.; _gold~_, _stoon~_, _vppon~_, which
it is hard to interpret. It has been collated with the three others by
Hausknecht, in his admirable critical edition of the poem.

2. #Cott.#, the Brit. Mus. MS. Cott. Vitell. D. III., which probably
belongs to the second half of the 13th century, suffered badly from fire
in 1731. Of the original 219 folios of this parchment MS., 26 remain,
and these are in many parts exceedingly difficult to read, so that the
readings here offered, which are based mainly on Lumby’s text, are
offered with apologies, and may no doubt be bettered here and there by
comparison with the other MSS. Our poem, which occupies folios 6a-8b of
the existing MS., is preceded by _Versus de historibus sacris veteris et
novi Testamenti, veteri lingua Gallicana_ (O. French), and in the same
handwriting with Fl. and Bl. The following folios (9-26) contain in
Latin prose, _Expositiones quaedam sive comentarii in Macrobii
Saturnalia_.

Of our poem only 451 lines are preserved in this MS., and of these only
180 are completely legible. The first verse corresponds to about v. 508,
and the last to about v. 2514 of the French. The writing is in a fine,
apparently French, book hand.

This MS. has been printed by Lumby in the original to the present
edition for the E.E.T.S., and has been used by Hausknecht in collation.

3. #A.#, the celebrated Auchinleck MS. of the Advocates’ Library in
Edinburgh, is a veritable mine of romance. Perhaps the best description
is still that given in Sir Walter Scott’s introduction to _Sir
Tristrem_, where is to be found an enumeration of the 44 different
articles, mostly romances, still contained (besides 13 lost). It is a
large quarto on vellum, and according to Ellis, belongs to the very
first of the 14th century. Of our poem, which occupies five
double-columned folios (100-104), 861 verses are contained, of which the
first corresponds to v. 1001 of the French.

Fl. and Bl. has twice been reprinted from the Auchinleck MS.: (1) C. H.
Hartshorne, Ancient Metrical Tales, London, 1829, (2) David Laing,
A Penni Worth of Witte, etc., Abbotsford Club, Edinburgh, 1857.

4. #C.#, the Cambr. Univ. MS. Gg. 4. 27. 2, has already been described.
(See page xxviii.) Of the fragment of a MS. that now exists, the final
824 verses of Fl. and Bl. occupy folios 1a-5b. The first verse preserved
corresponds to verse 1001 of the French poem.

The interrelations of these four MSS. have been carefully studied by
Hausknecht (as above, pp. 98-108), whose results may be summarized as
follows: MSS. A., Cott., T form a group _x_. Now #C.#, now group _x_ has
gaps, and neither is free from individual changes.

Within the group _x_, #A# and Cott. form a special sub-group, _y_ going
back to a common origin, but at the same time independent of each other.

We may borrow from Hausknecht the following diagram representing the
interrelations.

  T                             C ]

As regards the relative value of the different MSS., it must be said
that #T# is the least to be depended on for accuracy, but is valuable
because it preserves more of the early part of the story than is
preserved in any of the other MSS. As regards the relative value of #C#
and _x_ it is hard to decide. Still the instances in which #C#, in
opposition to #A#, agrees with the French are more numerous than are the
instances of the contrary case.

§ 1. INTRODUCTORY.

From the valorous atmosphere of King Horn and the sentimental atmosphere
of Floris and Blauncheflur, to the devout atmosphere of the
“Assumption,” is a very appreciable change. At the same time the
oriental romance of Floris and Blauncheflur and our legend, also, no
doubt, of eastern origin, betray their common descent in a certain
similarity of sentimental tone; and further, both romances, Germanic and
oriental, share to some extent their romantic colour with the religious
legend. It is perhaps the love of this romantic colour, which the three
poems have in common, that has brought them together in the Cambridge
MS. (Gg. 4. 27. 2) which forms the nucleus of the present volume, though
the fact that the existing manuscript is but a fragment, forbids any
certain conclusion as to the tastes and probable purpose of the
collector.


§ 2. SETTING.

In turning from the romances of King Horn and Floris and Blauncheflur to
the legend of the Assumption we are entering the most productive field
of early English literature. The religious element is the predominant
element in Anglo-Saxon poetry. Christianity, from the very first, was
received in England with an extraordinary warmth. In the year closely
following the conversion of England there came into bloom a rich
Christian poetry which soon took the place of, almost displaced, the
earlier national epos.

The Norman Conquest was the means of introducing a flood of romances of
every conceivable origin, and probably explains the slight revival of
genuine English romantic traditions such as those of Horn, Havelok and
Waldef, and possibly of Wade. But through the period, immediately
following the Conquest, of the domination of the French and Latin
languages in English literature, there had persisted a thread of the old
English tradition in the homilies which continued for a long time to be
industriously read and copied. With these in the 12th century were
associated new homilies (cf. R. Morris, Old English Homilies), the
direct lineal descendants of those of Alfric and Wulfstan, and in the
beginning of the 13th century, in the northern midlands the metrical
Ormulum, which betrays some French influence in a somewhat scanty French
element in its vocabulary and in its proper names (cf. F. Kluge, Engl.
Stud. xxii), but which nevertheless is composed quite in the style and
manner of the earlier time.

When, after two centuries, the English language had to some extent come
back into use as a language of literature, Cynewulf also found
successors, and the legend flourished once more. Indeed in this new
period it came to flourish to an extent hitherto unparalleled. This
revival was due in part, no doubt, to the story-telling spirit so
manifest in this period, and in part to the fact that this period marks
the highest point in the progress of saint worship.

Probably the earliest of these newer legends were those of St. Juliana,
St. Margeret and St. Katherine, which are written in rhythmical
alliterative prose clearly manifesting the earlier English tradition,
but which give premonition of a new era in the ring of a lyrical tone
and in the already richer, more highly coloured diction. (Cf. C.
Horstmann, Altenglische Legenden, Neue Folge, p. xv, Heilbronn, 1881.)
Quite romantic in tone and colour are the very early, fine poems, in
four-line strophes, of Katerine, Gregory, Mergrete, and the Magdalen,
all of which unfortunately are preserved only in later, remodeled forms,
and are perhaps only scant remains of an originally much richer
literature. (Cf. Horstmann, as above, p. xlii, 225, 242.) According to
Horstmann, the poems of Margaret and Gregory belong to the most
beautiful productions of the early English language. Even more finely
constructed, but rather lyric than narrative in form, are the few
legends which fall in with the movement, influenced by French and
especially strong in the South of England shortly before 1250, toward
the development of the religious lyric. (Cf. R. Morris, Old English
Miscellany.) Of these semi-lyrical legends, Eustas (MS. Digby 86) and
the legends of the Psalter (MSS. Digby and Auchinleck) are composed in
six-line strophes. (Cf. Horstmann, pp. 211, 228.) Other poems of this
period, such as the _xi Pains of Hell_, already have the short riming
couplet. Nearly to this same time belongs the Assumption of our Lady, in
riming pairs and also in the Southern dialect.

The Assumption thus finds its setting among the very finest of the
English legendary poems. According to Horstmann (as above, p. xliii):
‘Never again has legendary poetry reached the same height of pathos, the
same purity and beauty of form as in these older legends. The period
immediately following shows a decided falling off in poetic power and in
talent for form. The tone loses in depth and warmth, the style in
fullness and swing.’ In the last quarter of the 13th century, as we
shall see, the legendary poetry entered the service of the church, and
was worked over by the monks into great collections for reading in the
services. This no doubt explains the remarkable falling off in poetic
style and quality.


§ 3. THE RISE OF THE LEGEND.

The story of the rise[I-22] of the legend from the _Acta Martyrorum_,
the earliest records concerning the saints, to the martyrologies, the
records of the recognized martyrs in each individual church, which in
turn were expanded after the 8th century, from mere lists of names to
the Latin legendaries upon which rest the OE. collections of
legends,--all this forms an interesting chapter in the history of the
church and in the history of literature, but has no place here except in
so far as it throws light on the origin of the poem with which we are
concerned. The relation too of the legend to the service of the church
has a very much involved history. The _Lectiones_ or ‘readings’ in the
daily offices of the church were of three kinds: either (1) selections
from the Scriptures, or (2) selections from the commentaries or homilies
of the church fathers, or (3) the _Acta Sanctorum_. The last kind came
generally to be denoted as _Legenda_, or ‘legends.’ At first treated
with distrust, in time the legend came to play an important part in the
service of the church. It seems to have first found its full development
in the ‘nocturns,’ into which it was admitted apparently by the
Benedictines in the 8th century. There it first appeared in an amplified
and extended form.

The height of the legend’s development lies in the 12th and 13th
centuries, and coincides with the period (Horstmann, as above, p. xv) of
full bloom of the cult of the saints. At this time the number of saints’
days multiplied. Each church honoured its special saints. One celebrated
not alone the death-day of the saint, but that of the burial and the
translation. New saints came to be venerated, and long-forgotten ones
were again brought to memory. The relics and traditions were collected,
and the lives were written. Special church offices were made for them,
and hymns and songs were written in their praise. In these new _offices_
of the church the legend found its use. These special festivals often
fell on week-days, and one had to fill in _lectiones_ for which nothing
was ready. Under these circumstances the legend offered itself as if
expressly fitted, and became the key to the entire religious
celebration. In this situation, amid these most favourable
circumstances, the legend developed its full power, and must have been
an important factor in the religious life of the period.

In addition to this place of the legend in the offices of the church, it
came later to be read within, or instead of the sermon, after the
_Evangelium_ during the mass, and in the popular language. From very
early times it was permitted to the clergy, in place of original
productions to read the homilies of others, and to this usage, no doubt,
we owe such collections as the Blickling Homilies, Bede’s _Homiliae de
tempore_, Aelfric’s collections, the Ormulum, etc. That the early
legends were intended to be delivered as sermons, or in sermons, is
apparent from the frequent direct appeals to the congregation, and from
their association, in the MSS., with homilies.

During the 11th and 12th centuries the homily, the older element,
continued to prevail even on saints’ days, but in the 13th and 14th
centuries the homily came to be in great measure displaced by the legend
on the festival days of the saints, and was used only for Sundays and
for the _Festae Christi_. To make a complete _liber festivalis_, either
to the book of homilies was joined a legendary for saints’ days, or
later the legendary, on the other hand, absorbed the book of homilies,
as happened for instance in the case of the _Legenda aurea_, which marks
the final step in the development of the Latin legendary, and which
presents the homilies of the _Festae Christi_, perhaps the remains of
the book of homilies, side by side with the legends. In the north of
England the collection of _Evangelia dominicalia_, that is to say the
gospels for Sundays and _Festae Christi_, which, according to the
original plan, embraced only the Sunday gospel readings with their
_expositio_ and a _narratio_ (_i.e._ a legendary narrative as an
illustration) came in later MSS. to be supplemented by a collection of
legends, evidently intended to complete the work by providing also for
the saints’ days something in the place of the _proprium sanctorum_
(_i.e._ gospels for saints’ days). In the South of England, on the other
hand, the complete _liber festivalis_ grows out of the legendary, which
comes to include the homilies.

To sum up, the place of the _evangelium_ in the mass for saints’ days
comes to be filled by the legend, while in the mass on Sunday, the
_evangelium_ is still retained, though probably often supplemented by an
_expositio_ and a _narratio_, or legendary tale as illustration for the
_expositio_. In consequence the _liber festivalis_ falls into two parts,
the _temporal_ (for Sundays and _Festae Christi_) and the _sanctoral_,
or legendary for the saints’ days.

    [Footnote I-22: Cf. Horstmann, as above, pp. xxviii ff.]


§ 4. PLACE OF OUR LEGEND OF THE ASSUMPTION.

What then was the original function of our legend of the Assumption? The
_evangelium_ and the homily, as we have seen, still retained their
places, in part at least, in the _temporal_, where the Assumption would
belong, but were supplemented by legendary anecdotes, or even by entire
legends. Was our poem originally intended for a place in the religious
service, or was it rather a lyrico-romantic production with a sacred
theme? What was the original purpose of the poem, it is not easy to
determine. In actual use, however, it seems to have played a double
role. In two of the six MSS. in which the present version of the story
is preserved (viz. the Chetham MS. and Cambr. Univ. MS. Gg. 4. 27. 2.),
the legend is associated with romances, and we must infer that it is the
romantic quality of the legend that has appealed to the collectors.
(Cf. also the slightly different version in the Auchinleck MS.) In the
other four MSS., however, the associations, as will be seen later, are
distinctly religious, though Harl. MS. 2382 seems rather a literary
collection than one designed for church use. In all of the MSS. the poem
is referred to as a tale (cf. Harl. MS. 2253, near the end, where occurs
the line, _This tale y haue tolde wit mouthe_), and as a _lesson_, that
is to say a ‘reading,’ and if we may judge by the general tone of the
different versions, the place for this ‘reading’ was quite likely the
church. Even if the reading was not confined to the church, it usually
was of a professionally religious character as we must judge from the
remarkable conclusion in Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 10036:

  We biseche þee for alle þat hereþ þis vie
  Off oure ladi seynt marie,
  That Ih{es}u schelde hem fram g{ra}me
  Fro dedly synne {and} fro schame,
  Ne mysauenture schal bi falle þ{a}t man
  That þis a vie here can.
  Ne no womman þat ilke dai,
  That of oure ladi hereþ þis lai,
  Dien ne schal of hure childe;
  For oure ladi hure schal be mylde.
  Ne noone mys-auenture schall be-falle,
  In felde, in strete, ne in halle,
  In stede þer þis vie is rad,
  For oure ladi hure sone it bad,
  And þe archibisshop, seynt Edmou{n}d,
  Haþ g{ra}unted xl. daies to p{ar}dou{n}
  To alle þat þis vie wol here,
  Or with good wille wol lere. vv. 879-896.


§ 5. ORIGIN.

The legend of the Assumption, according to ten Brink (Geschichte der
engl. Litt. I, p. 331), had its origin in the second half of the 4th
century. Tischendorf (Act. Apocr. p. xxxiv, Leipzig, 1866) believes a
still earlier origin to be not impossible. The story had a wide
circulation in the East. Besides the Greek versions we know (cf. F.
Gierth, Engl. Stud. vii, pp. pp. 1-33) of three Syriac, one Arabic, and
one Sahidic version. Even in Ethiopia there exists a similar tale
(Journ. of Sacr. Lit. and Bibl. Rec., Jan. 1865, p. 48). From the orient
the legend spread into the literatures of western Christendom.
Tischendorf (as above, p. xliii.) gives a list of a dozen Latin
manuscripts of the legend, and from these he offers critical editions of
two versions, which, with Gierth, we may indicate as: (1) _Transitus
Mariae_, #A# (Tischendorf, pp. 113 ff.) in Latin prose; (2) _Transitus
Mariae_, #B#, a fuller version differing from #A# in some respects,
notably in the absence of the scene in which Thomas appears.

Other Latin versions are those published by Th. Graesse: (1) The
section, _De assumtione beatae Mariae virginis in Jacobi a Voragine
Legenda Aurea_,[I-23] ed. Th. Graesse, _Dresdae et Lipsiae_, 1846, pp.
504 ff., (2) _De modo assumtionis beatae Mariae_, published by Graesse,
as above, pp. 517 ff.

In French may be mentioned the version by Wace (_L’Établissement de la
fête de la conception Nôtre-Dame dite la fête aux Normands_. Caen, 1842,
or, in another edition, _Vie de la vierge Marie_, Tours, 1859). For
account of other unpublished French versions cf. E. Stengel,
_Mittheilungen aus franz. hss._, etc., Halle, 1873, pp. 20 ff.

In German we may mention the version by Conrad v. Heimesfurt, about 1200
(HZ. viii, pp. 150 ff.).

Our story in its present form seems to have made its first appearance in
England in the French version, above mentioned, by Wace, in the second
quarter of the 12th century. (Cf. however, _Assumptio sanctae Mariae
virginis_, Blickling Homilies, E.E.T.S. 58, 63, 73.) Of an English
version of the present form of the legend, for English hearers, we have
no trace before the middle of the following century, from which it seems
we are to infer that the legend remained the property of the French
clericals about a century before coming into general circulation in the
English-speaking world. This earliest English version of the story is
the one of the present edition in short riming couplets.

What then was the source of this earliest English version? Was it
derived from Wace, or does it rest on one of the Latin versions? Wace’s
poem consists of three parts (cf. Gierth, Engl. Stud. vii, p. 6): (1)
the institution of the feast of the Conception of Mary, (2) her birth,
rearing and marriage, (3) her death and burial. For the first part his
source seems to have been the _Miraculum de conceptione sanctae Mariae_;
for the second part, the _Evangelium de nativitate Sanctae Mariae_.
About these two works, which he has followed almost word for word, Wace
grouped a number of minor anecdotes and commentary notes from Anselm,
Eadmer, and other of the church writers of the 11th and 12th centuries.
For part (3) Wace seems certainly to have used the Latin version of the
story, designated by Tischendorf as _Transitus Mariae_, #B#.

The English version has in common with Wace’s poem some traits that in
the other versions are wanting. For instance, only in these two versions
is it related that Mary cared for and instructed the maidens in the
temple. (Engl. vv. 60 ff.) Another feature in common is contained in the
speech of Christ to his mother shortly before her death, in which he
promises her, _La porte d’aidier auras A trestous ceus que tu vorras_
(Wace, p. 71, vv. 6, 7), which the English poet seems to have expanded
into a number of verses, in which is promised pardon to every sinner who
will betake himself to Mary.

On the other hand, in several instances the English agrees more closely
with the Latin, where Wace has considerably abridged, and in these
instances the French cannot have been the original of the English poem.
A Latin original seems much more probable. The first two-thirds of the
English poem corresponds almost exactly with the Tischendorf Latin #B#
version. On the other hand, the introduction of Thomas in the last
one-third of the poem is a feature of the Latin #A# version, but is
foreign to #B#. In other respects the English poem corresponds more
closely to a third Latin version from which Tischendorf quotes variants,
the _Codex Laurentius_. The English has in common with the _Legenda
Aurea_ the peculiar trait of making no mention of the miraculous transit
of John from Ephesus. Again, some traits in Latin #B# do not appear in
the English version, and, on the other hand, the English version
contains a few traits not to be found in any of the other versions
spoken of.

From the above we must conclude either that the English version rests on
a very composite version of which we do not know, or that the composer
of the English version was very eclectic, and selected his material from
very different sources. The latter explanation seems the more probable
one. In this connection it is important to note an observation first
made by Zarncke and afterwards corroborated by Kölbing (Engl. Stud. ii,
pp. 281-2) that the different prose versions of legends influence each
other reciprocally, producing mixed or composite forms of the legend
(_mischredactionen_) whose exact descent it is impossible to trace. It
is here that the learned element makes itself felt and differentiates
the tradition of a legend from the tradition of a romance or of a song.
The influence of this learned element we must probably assume in
explaining the tradition of our legend of the Assumption, which seems to
be a _mischredaction_.

    [Footnote I-23: A legend cycle composed in Latin prose by the
    Italian Jacobus a Voragine, Bishop of Genoa.]


§ 6. OTHER ENGLISH VERSIONS.

The story of the Assumption seems to have circulated, as we have seen,
both as a romantic story and as a devout legend. It must have been in
the first of these two _rôles_ that it was admitted to the famous
collection of romances in the Auchinleck MS. Here the story appears in a
new dress, composed in six-line strophes, with _rime couée_, probably
under the influence of the ballad singers. The content of this version
(cf. M. Schwarz, Engl. Stud. viii, pp. 428 ff.) seems to be
substantially that of the earlier version of the present volume. The
first stanza of this version is,--

  Who so bereȝ palm, þe tokne is þis,
  Þat in clene lif he is;
  Þat is to vnderstonde:
  Hit is tokning of loue,
  Þat god him haueȝ wraththe forȝoue,
  Þat bereȝ palm on honde.

The Assumption also forms a member of the Southern cycle of legends,
which go to form a legendary. In this _rôle_ it appears in Harl. MS.
2277, “a parchment book in a long 4to, imperfect at the beginning and
elsewhere; which formerly contained the legends of the Saints, etc.,
according to the course of the year, written in very old English
verse.... The handwriting of this MS. seems to be older than that year”
(1320). The MS. contains 69 legends, of which number 38 is _Assumpcio S.
Marie_, in 246 long riming lines, the first two of which are,--

  Seinte marie godes moder : f{ra}m þaposteles nas noȝt
  Þo þe holi gost a wit sonedai : among hem was ibroȝt.

This version seems to rest on the _Legenda Aurea_[I-24] as an original,
although the incident of the tardy arrival of Thomas, which is contained
in the Latin, is wanting in this version.

This same version appears in a later MS., Bodl. 779,[I-25] of the 16th
century. In this MS. the legend cycle is greatly extended by the
addition of a whole new series of legends. The number of legends in this
MS. reaches the number of 135, of which the version of the Assumption is
number 57.

Another version of our legend is that belonging to the Northern legend
cycle, and preserved in two MSS.: Harl. 4196 and Cott. Tiber. E.
VII,[I-26] of which the latter is the older, but the former the more
complete. These two texts correspond word for word, and apart from
possible scribal blunder, letter for letter, abbreviation for
abbreviation. Harl. MS. 4196 is a large folio on parchment, evidently of
about the middle of the 14th century, and written in a beautiful large
hand of the Northern type. It has 258 double-columned leaves, and
contains (1) several parts of the gospel in verse, which end at fol. 132
_a_, then after a blank page, (2) collection of legends in verse, with
special title and an introduction of eight verses (folios 133-205), then
as a sort of appendix, (3) a metrical gospel of Nicodemus (folios
206-215 _a_), and (4) the Prick of Conscience in verse. This version,
which appears as number 8 in the second division, the legend collection
of the Harl. MS., and whose text is identical in the two MSS. above
mentioned, opens as follows,--

  Of mari milde now will I mene
  Þat of all heuyns es corond quene
  And lady of all erth to tell
  And also Emp{er}ise of hell.

Another version belonging to the Southern cycle is that contained in the
younger MS. of this cycle, Lambeth MS. 223, a 4to parchment from the
beginning of the 15th century. (Cf. Horstmann, Neue Folge, p. xlvii. and
Notes.) In this MS. the Assumption appears, not in the legendary itself,
but as the fifth and last division in the _temporal_, which is prefixed
to the Southern cycle of legends. This version has frequent rimes within
the verse, and the last half verse has four stresses. The version agrees
in many respects with the Northern one just described and also with the
earlier Southern version, the one of our present volume. The opening
lines are as follows,--

  Herkkenes alle gode men, ȝif ȝe ben wise and slye
  And I wole to ȝow rede þe assumpcioun of Marie
  How she was from erþe taken into heuen on hegh
  And þere she shal euer wone and sitte Ihesu negh.

Another English version of our legend is that incorporated into the
Cursor Mundi (vv. 19993-20064). This version is translated into a
Northern dialect from a Southern English poem. (Cf. Cursor Mundi, ed. by
R. Morris, Introduction by Dr. Haenisch, pp. 42 ff.)

  And sant edmund o ponteni
  Dais o pardun þam gis tuenti
  In a writt þis ilk i fand,
  He-self it wroght, ic understand.
  In sotherin englis was it draun
  And turnd it haue i till our aun
  Langage o northrin lede,
  Þat can nan oþer englis rede.
  vv. 20057-64.

The poet of Cursor Mundi follows the Southern author nearly line for
line, so that there cannot be the slightest doubt that he refers to the
Southern English version of the present volume. But now and then he has
made additions, for some of which Haenisch finds no source. (Horstmann
believes this version to have been translated from Wace.)

The fact that the poet of Cursor Mundi “attributes his original to
Edmund of Pontenay was caused by a misunderstanding of the lines 893-96
of the SE. Assumption” (Haenisch).

  Cursor Mundi, vv. 20057-60.

  And sant edmund o ponteni
  Dais o pardun þam gis tuenti;
  In a writt þis ilk i fand
  He self it wroght, ic understand.

    Assumption, vv. 893-6.

    And þe archibisshop seynt Edmound
    Haþ graunted xl. daies to pardoun
    To alle þat þis vie wol here
    Or with good wille wol lere.

Still another version, which formed part of a work by Barbour, the
author of the Scotch collection of legends, is mentioned in his
prologue, but, along with the rest of this work referred to, is
unfortunately lost.

Still further deserving of mention are (1) the prose version contained
in the ‘Festial’ of Johannes Mirkus (Horstmann, Neue Folge, pp.
cix. ff.), a collection of sermons, derived for the most part from the
_Legenda Aurea_ and written about 1400 for the festivals of the church,
Festae Christi and Saints’ days;[I-27] and (2) that contained in the
English translation of the _Legenda Aurea_ (cf. Horstmann, Neue Folge,
pp. cxxx ff.). “The Assumption of oure ladi” stands 111 in Harl. MS.
4775.

The above enumeration of versions of our legend will demonstrate
effectively its popularity in England, also its use in the service of
the church. Further investigation is needed to determine more exactly
the interrelations of the various versions, though it is doubtful if
such an investigation would produce any very conclusive results, since,
as suggested above, many versions of the legends were probably mixed
versions (_mischredactionen_).

§ 7. MANUSCRIPTS.

The earliest English version, the one of the present volume, is known to
exist in six manuscripts.

1. Cambr. Univ. MS. Gg. 4. 27. 2. (For description cf. introduction to
King Horn, p. xxviii.) This fragmentary text (240 lines) is printed in
the present volume.

2. Chetham MS. 8009, Manchester, a collection of romances and legends.
(For description cf. Engl. Stud. vii, 195 ff., viii, pp. 1 ff.)

3. Cambr. Univ. MS. Dd. 1. 1., a long narrow MS. from about the middle
of the 14th century and written in a large, informal, very legible hand.
The content of the MS. is the Northern collection of _Evangelia
dominicalia_, with which is included, in addition to the sermons with
legends attached for the festivals of John and Peter and Paul, also our
Southern legend poem of the Assumption, which is perhaps to be
attributed to the scribe (named Staundon), who is Southern. (For a full
account of this MS. cf. Horstmann, Neue Folge, p. xxvi. and pp.
lxvii. ff.) This text of 544 verses has not been printed.

4. Cambr. Univ. MS. Ff. 2. 38, a paper MS. in an informal but legible
hand by a Southern scribe. It contains miscellaneous religious writings,
the list of which I neglected to copy. Our poem is followed by “þe lyfe
of seynt Kateryn.” This text of 770 verses has not been printed.

5. Harl. MS. 2382, a paper book in 4to, in an informal hand, and
containing nine miscellaneous theological poems by Lydgate, Chaucer,
etc. Poem number 1 is Lydgate’s Life of the Virgin Mary, four books at
the end of which stands this note, _Explicit quartus liber de sancta
Maria_. The second poem is our present version of the Assumption,
evidently the end of a sequel to Lydgate’s poem, for at the end stands
the note, _Explicit Sextus liber Sancte Marie_, which shows that two
other books were added to the original four of Lydgate, written in
stanzas, to King Henry V. The other contents of this MS. seem also to be
literary, and are as follows: 3. _Oracio ad Sanctam Mariam_, 4. _The
Testament of Dan Johan Lydgate_, 5. _Fabula Mornalis de Sancta Maria_,
Chaucer’s Prioress’s Tale, 6. _Vita Sancte Cecilie_, Chaucer’s Second
Nonne’s Tale, 7. _De Sancto Erasmo Martire_, 8. _Testamentum Cristi_, 9.
_The Childe of Bristow_. This text of 710 verses is in part reprinted in
the present volume.

6. Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 10036, a small parchment volume (about 8 × 4) of
100 folios, written in black letter, perhaps in the second half of the
14th century, and containing a miscellaneous religious collection: (1)
History of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem by Vespasian
(ff. 1-61), (2) The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin (ff. 62-80), (3)
A question of the peynes of helle (prose, ff. 81-84), (4) Here bigynneth
the thre arowis that God schal schete at domys-dais apon hem that
schullen be dampned (prose, ff. 85-91), (5) The seven petitions in the
Pater Noster (prose, ff. 91-94), (6) Ave Maria, Pardons and Indulgences
for repeating (prose, f. 94), (7) Ten Commandments trans. and expl.
(prose, ff. 94-96), (8) The 51st Psalm, _Miserere mei_, trans. into
English verse (96-100). This text, in 904 verses, is printed in the
present volume.

If for the sake of conformity with the German investigations, we
designate Cambr. MS. Gg. 9. 27. 2. as #A#, Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 10036 as
#B#, Harl. MS. 2382 as #C#, Cambr. MS. Dd. 1. 1. as #D#, Cambr. MS. Ff.
2. 38. as #E#, and Chetham MS. as #Ch.#, then the interrelations of the
different texts of this version are about as follows (F. Gierth, Engl.
Stud. vii, pp. 1 ff.). #A# and #B# form a special group as opposed to
#C#, #D#, #E#, on the one hand, and to #Ch.# alone, on the other. No one
of these versions is the direct source of any other. The different texts
may be characterized somewhat as follows:

#A# offers the best text as far as it goes.

#B# introduces many important changes, and seems to be somewhat confused
in the order of events, but in the passages preserved intact, preserves
the text and the rime better than do #C#, #D#, or #E#.

#C# gives best the true course of the story, but often alters the rime,
in particular, individual rime words.

#D# has many gaps, and is particularly defective after the entrance on
the scene of Thomas.

#E# stands in closer relation to #D# than to #C#, and often takes an
intermediate position between #C# and #D#. #Ch.# (cf. M. Schwarz, Engl.
Stud. viii, p. 460) we must regard as a compilation of different MSS.,
and owes its origin perhaps to oral tradition. In the case of #Ch.#, as
in the case of the other texts of this version, it will be safer not to
set up any diagram representing the interrelations of MSS., since these
MSS. are no doubt all of them influenced by written as well as by oral
tradition, and, as has been pointed out above, there is at least a
possibility, as in the case of #Ch.#, of mixed versions. In dealing with
legend, even less than in dealing with romance, does one have to do with
a purely epic growth.


§ 8. TIME AND PLACE OF COMPOSITION.

We have already seen that the author of Cursor Mundi attributes the
authorship of this version of the Assumption to Edmund of Pontenay
(pp. liii, liv, above). But we have also seen the probable source of his
error. In one thing the Northern writer is no doubt right, when he says
(v. 20061), “In sotherin englis was it draun.” The poem is undoubtedly
Southern in origin. To gain more definite knowledge is not easy. The
rimes, our usual guide in such cases, in this poem are very uncertain.
The writer’s ear seems to have been not a delicate one. He does not
distinguish carefully open _ę̨̄_ and close _ẹ̄_, e.g. _here_ : _lere_ 4
Add., _wel_ : _del_ 212 C, 206 D, 218 Add., 256 C, 262 Add., _were_ :
_here_ 716 Add., etc.

In a similar way he does not distinguish carefully open _ǭ_ and close
_ọ̄_, e.g. _gone_ : _done_ 86 Add., 594 H, _done_ : _one_ 416 Add.,
562 H, 588 H, 750 Add., _anon_ : _done_ 530 Add., _sloo_ : _doo_ 508 H,
_þo_ : _do_ 262 D, etc. In consequence we are not able to apply the
_-wǭ-_, _-wọ̄-_ test with any degree of certainty. OE. _-wā_ rimes, now
with _ǭ_, now with _ọ̄_, e.g. _fro_ : _so_ 342 Add., 324 D, _so_ : _fo_
374 Add., _tho_ : _so_ 278 H, _also_ : _mo_ 17 C, etc.; but _so_ : _to_
179 C, 184 Add., 214 C, 296 C, 300 Add., 314 H, 344 Add., 718 Add., 904
Add., _atwo_ : _do_ 280 H, _whom_ : _come_ 306 F (_wham_ : _cam_ 336
Add.), etc.

In the same way OE. _æ_, and shortened OE. _ǣ_, rimes now with _a_, now
with _e_, e.g. _was_ : _gracias_ 310 Add., 774 Add., _Thomas_ : _was_
656 C, _Iosephas_ : _was_ 582 H; but _fless_ : _was_ 34 C, _best_ :
_lest_ 392 H, _fed_ : _bed_ 124 C, 132 A, _les_ : _wes_ 566 D.

In the same way OE. _y_ rimes now with _e_, now with _i_, e.g. _stede_ :
_dude_ 57 C, 62 Add., 88 Add., 800 Add., 82 C, 624 Add., _kyng_ : _geng_
220 C, _him_ (= ‘them’) : _kyn_ 642 Add.; but _mankyne_ : _pyne_ 426 A,
_Inne_ : _kynne_ 430 A, 478 A, 360 H, 338 D, 346 D, _it_ : _pytt_ 506 H,
_þerynne_ : _synne_ 604 H, _blisse_ : _gladnesse_ 384 H, etc.

In the same way in the 3rd plur. pres. indic., the ending is sometimes
_-eþ_, sometimes _-n_, e.g. _listneþ_ 8 C, _serueþ_ 418 H, _goth_ 476 H,
593 A, _buþ_ 22 C, 26 C, etc.; but _ben_ 25 A, _beon_ 141 C, 149 A,
etc., and the rime _kenesmen_ : _ben_ 122 C, 130 A.

Details may be multiplied indefinitely to show the general Southern
character of the language, _e.g._ the verbal endings in _-i_ or _-y_, as
_blessi_ : _herkni_ 7, 8 C, _loky_ 47 C, _gladie_ 75 C, etc.; the
infinitive preserving its final _-n_, as _quene_ : _bene_ 6 Add.,
_bene_ : _ysene_ 40 A, _gon_ : _on_ 140 C, _quen_ : _ben_ 98 C, 104 A,
114 C, 120 A, etc.; but _beo_ : _gleo_ 10 C, etc.; the present
participle in _-and_, as _lepand_ : _hande_ 614 A, etc.; the use of the
palatalized consonants, as in _yyeue_ 566 H, _ayene_ 597 H, etc.

The dialect then certainly is of the Southern part of England; but the
rimes do not enable one to locate the dialect more exactly. The
composition is undoubtedly that of a scholar in whom one might expect a
wider range in pronunciation. Doubtless both Southern and Midland
dialects were familiar to him. The pronunciation, however, of OE. _y_ as
_e_ and of OE. _æ_ as _e_ belongs to the East Southern, and we shall
probably be safe in calling the dialect a compromise between East
Southern and East Midland.

The time of composition was probably not later than 1250. The OE. _ā_
had regularly changed to _ǭ_ (if we neglect an isolated instance like
_thomas_ : _ras_ 822 A); but I find no certain instance of lengthening
in open syllables, and further, the oldest MS. (C) is not much later
than 1250, as we have seen. It preserves the unmonophthonged _eo_, e.g.
_weop_ 29, _treo_ 35, _heo_ 36, _beo_ 37, _iseo_ 38, etc.


§ 9. VERSIFICATION.

The legend, like the romance of Floris and Blancheflur, is composed in
short riming pairs. Each verse nominally has four metrical stresses. The
rime may be either masculine or feminine. Frequently assonance takes the
place of perfect rime; e.g. _weop_ : _fet_ 30 C, _gode_ : _fote_ 70
Add., _þolen_ : _y-boren_ 220 Add., etc.

NOTES.


KING HORN.

4, H. _Allof_. An undoubted trace of the influence of the French version
on the H text of the English version. The French has _Aaluf_.

6. _laste_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 7017: _þe while þe hit ilæste_.

8. _Fairer ..._ Cf. ‘The Erl of Tolous’ (ed. by G. Lüdtke, Berlin,
1881): _were no fayrer undyr hevyn, That any man myght see, Fayre myght
none bee_. 354. Cf. also 980-1. Further, ‘The King of Tars.’ (Engl.
Stud. xi. pp. 1 ff.): _Feirer miȝt non ben oliue_ 8.

10, C. _miste_. In many southern texts the _s-_ initial has the phonetic
value _sh-_. Hence here it is to be assumed that medial _-st-_ has the
pronunciation _-sht_, a loose way of representing the pronunciation of
the _-ht_, _-ȝt_ like German _-cht_ in _nicht_, etc.

11, 12. _rine_ : _schine_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 31889-90: _þa sunne gon to scine,
Þe rein bigon to rine_; 28303, _muchel rein him gon rine_; 31086-7, _nis
nan feirure wifmon þa whit sunne seineð on_.

14. _briȝt so þe glas_. Cf. ‘Rich. C. de L.’ (Weber, Early Engl.
Romances, II.). 75. _And a lady þerinne was bryght as the sunne thorough
glas._

15. _whit so þe flur_. Cf. ‘Rich. C. de L.’: _off that lady whyt so
flour_, 128.

17, 18. _bold_ : _old_. Cf. ‘The Erl of Tolous’: _He was a feyr chyld
and a bolde, Twenty wyntur he was oold_, 712-13; Reinbroun 4, 4. _Faire
child he was and bolde, He was boute seue winter olde._ ‘Beues’
3899-3900: _Be þat he was seue winter old, He was a fair child and a
bold_.

19, 20. _iliche_. Cf. ‘Guy of Warwick’ 1336: _In all þys worlde ys none
hym lyke_.

21, H. _tueye feren_. The H text here lacks one of the archaic features
of the story, referring to only two companions, viz., Aþulf and
Fikenhild. The other ten, save for the abrupt introduction of Arnoldin
at the conclusion, play no active part in the present version.

23. _riche menne sones_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 28932-3: _monies riches monnes sune,
monie hæðene gume_.

25. _for to_ with infinitive. This is frequent, especially in H, and is
probably due to French influence, _por à_. Cf. 166 L, 242 H, 388 C H,
902, 1011, 1186, etc.

27. _him het_. For frequent use of reflexives cf. 134 L, 140 C L, 147 C,
173 C, 233 L, 293 C, 294, 526 C, 307 C, 364, 398 C, 426, 806 L, 802 L,
1250, 1269, 1297-8, 1386, 1410, 1545.

27, H. _Athulf_. In the early part of the H text _th_ is used in proper
names.

31-35. Cf. ‘Erl of Tolous’ 181-3: _So hyt befell upon a day, The erl
and he went to play, Be a reuer syde_. Cf. also ‘Lyb. Disc.’ 25, 26
(Ritson): _As hyt befelle upon a day, To wode he wente on hys play_;
also ‘Lay.’ 25661 A, _bi þere sæ side_; ‘Lyb. Disc.’ 645-6: _Yesterday
yn the mornynge y wente on my playnge_.

42. _sarazins_. The conventional enemy in mediaeval romance. Probably
due to French influence and ultimately due to the stories originating in
the crusades and in the struggles between Mohammedans and Christians
culminating in the Battle of Tours.

44. _Oþer to londe brohte_. Murry mistakes them for merchants (cf. also
637-8). The whole incident, vv. 39-62, reminds one of the quite parallel
historical incident of the first landing of the Northmen in 787, and the
death of Beaduheard and his retinue.

45. _Payn_. Cf. Note on _Sarazins_, 42. _of herde_, an unusual
combination. This is the only instance cited in Bradley-Stratmann.

55. _gunne_ = ‘did’ intensive, as frequently. See _gan_ in Glossary,
also _con_, _couþe_, _began_.

57. _vnder schelde_ means perhaps ‘in arms.’ Cf. ‘Rich. C. de L.’
5691-3: _And yiff the sawdon off that land Myghte sloo Richard in that
feeld With swerd or spere undyr scheeld_. Cf. also Wissmann’s note.

67-8. _libbe_ : _sibbe_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 11605-6: _þenne maȝen we libben mid
sæhten & mid sibben_ (Wissmann).

69. _hi here_. The representatives of the OE. forms of the personal
pronouns are usually very strictly adhered to. _þei_, _þe_ occurs twice
(55 L and 1557 C), _sche_ once (380 L), ‘their’ and ‘them,’ not at all.

69, 70. _asoke_ : _toke_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 12114-16: _& sūme heo god wiðsoken
& to haðenescipe token_ (Wissmann). Also ‘Lay.’ 29187-8: _for crist
seolue he for soc, and to þon wursen he tohc_.

82, L. _hundes_. Cf. also 91 L, 634 C H, 887, 1465, etc. For a possible
explanation of the term cf. ‘Rich. C. de L.’ 337-40: _Upon his creste a
rede hounde. The tayle henge to the grounde. That was Sygnyfycacioun The
hethene folke to brynge down._ Cf. 634 Note.

89, 90. _made_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 28067-8: _deoren swið hende, þa ure drihten
make_ (Wissmann). The contracted form _made_ of L H, is that of the
original as shown by the rime and rhythm.

92. _quic flen_ perhaps a trace of a primitive custom in this
crystallized phrase (cf. also 1468 C).

98. _iseene_. Cf. Chaucer, ‘Knight’s Tale’ 65: _Now be we caytifs as it
is wel seene_ (Wissmann).

100. _strong_ : _long_. Cf. ‘Havelok’ 2242-3: _Non so fayr, ne non so
long, ne non so mikel ne non so strong_.

107, C. _stere_. Cf. Glossary.

109. Cf. the parallel historical incident where Aethelstan sets his
brother Eadwine adrift, in Thorpe’s translation of Lappenberg’s England
under the Anglo-Saxon Kings, II, iii, London, 1845 (Wissmann).

118. _wringinde_. Cf. ‘Havelok’ 152: _He wrungen hondes and wepen sore_
(Wissmann).

121-122. _wo_ : _þo_. A stereotyped couplet in romance. Cf. ‘Lay.’
8429-30, 20383-4, 8677-8, ‘Sir Isumbras’ 380-1, 759-60, ‘Rich. C. de L.’
6521-2.

123. _Horns_. Perhaps a scribal error, so common in this MS.; perhaps a
trace of the OF. inflection with _-s_ in the nom. sing. Cf. _Horns_
1560 H, _enimis_ 1023 C, 1024 H; also _page_ and _crois_ in Glossary.

127. _flowe_. Cf. ‘Proverbs of Alfred,’ v. 197 (M. and S. selections):
_Uppe þe see þat floweþ_. Kölbing (Eng. Stud. vi. 154) thinks _flowe_
means ‘flood’ as distinguished from ‘ebb.’

128. _rowe_. The ‘ship’ was a ‘galeie,’ cf. 199, 1084, 1086, etc.: cf.
also ‘Rich. C. de L.’ 2521-4: _They rowede hard, and sungge ther too
With henelow and rumbelooo. The galeye wente also faste As quarrel dos
off the arweblast._

131-2. _ywis_ : _ymis_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 19067-8: _for æuere heo wende ful
iwis þat it weoren þe eorl Gorlois_.

134. _sprang_. Cf. ‘Owl and Nighting.’ 734: _Wane þe liȝt of daie
springe_. Also ‘Ipomydon’ 776: _To-morrow, or the day sprynge_. Hence
the modern word ‘dayspring.’ For reflexive phrase, _him sprong_, cf. 27
Note.

150, L. _dawes_, the natural phonetic development from OE. nom. accus.
plur. _dagas_. The more usual forms _daies_, _dayes_, are formed by
analogy with the singular.

161, C H. _hol and fer_. Cf. ‘Ass.’ 62 Cambr.: _so hol ne fer_.

168. _dales and dune_. A common collocation of words. Cf. ‘Lay.’
27352-3: _iseȝen alle þa dales, alle þa dunes_ (Wissmann).

170. _blessing_. The accent on the second syllables of dissyllabic words
as revealed by the rimes in ‘Horn’ is an interesting feature. This
accent is no doubt in part to be explained as a French characteristic,
in part as the survival of an OE. secondary accent. For further
instances cf. 209-10, 219-20, 233-4, 239-40, 243-4, 253-4, 263-4,
359-60, 467-8, 529-30, 609-10, 859-60, 1169-70, 1235-6, etc.

174. _mild_. Cf. ‘Rich. C. de L.’ 6887-8: _Tho sayde to hym with mylde
stevene_, also a frequent phrase in the ‘Assumption.’

176. _beoþ icumene_. For other examples of _beon_ as auxiliary cf. _beþ
ygo_ 310 H, _am iorne_ 1228 C, etc. Cf. also ‘Lay.’ 13838-9: _whæt
cnihten ȝe seon & whænnenen ȝe icumen beon_.

175 ff. Compare with Aylmer’s greeting the in many ways similar greeting
of Vortiger to Hengest and Horsa. ‘Lay.’ 13826 ff.

180-2. _Ne sauȝ ihc ..._ Cf. 180-2 Note.

202. _sail and roþer_. Cf. ‘R. H.’ 60-61: _Kil naient auirum dunt a (!)
seient aidanȝ sigle ne guuernad (!) dunt il seient naianȝ_.

204. _brymme_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 272: _ferde bi þere sæ brimme_ (Wissmann).

206. _honde bihynde_. Cf. Wissmann’s parallel citations from Alexander
(Weber, as above I.) 2013 ff. and ‘Chron. of Engl.’ (Ritson II.) 873.

208. _spille_. Cf. ‘Havelok’ 242: _Helpe me nu in þis nede and late ye
nouth mi bodi spille_ (Wissmann).

210. _Niþing_. Cf. Wissmann’s note.

221. _schulle_. Cf. Wissmann’s note and citation from ‘Oct. Imp.’ (Weber
III.). 535. _to blowe swyþe schylle_.

239 ff. Horn’s education. Cf. the similar scene in the later romance,
‘Ipomydon’ 32 ff., which, like ‘Rich. C. de L.,’ has many traits in
common with King Horn, and was no doubt influenced by King Horn. (Weber,
as above, II, pp. 281 ff.):

  _A feyrer child myght no man see_
  _Tholomew a clerk he toke,_
  _That taught the chyld vppon the boke,_
  _Bothe to synge and to rede;_
  _And after he taught hym other dede;_
  _Aftirward to serve in halle_
  _Bothe to grete and to smalle_
  _Before the kyng mete to kerve,_
  _Hye and lowe feyre to serve:_
  _Bothe of howndis and haukis game_
  _Aftir he taught hym, all and same._
  _In se, in feld, and eke in ryuère_
  _In wodde to chase the wild dere_
  _And in the feld to ryde a stede_
  _That all men had joy of his dede_

Verses 67-70 of ‘Ipomydon’ remind more directly of the French version,
‘R. H,.’ so that perhaps it was by this version of the Horn story that
the composer of ‘Ipomydon’ was influenced.

244. _Of wude and of riuere_. Cf. the similar phrase in ‘R. H.’ 377: _De
bois e de riuere, refait il autre tal_.

247 ff. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 4893 ff.: _Brennes wes swiðe hende [v] his hap wes þe
betere. Brennes cuðe on hundes, Brennes cuðe on hauekes, he cuðe mid his
honden hanlie þa harpe._

250. _Cupe serue_. Cf. ‘Ipomydon’ (as above) 295, where the princess
says to Ipomydon, “_Of the cuppe ye shall serve me_,” and 320 where
Ipomydon does serve with the cup. Cf. also ‘R. H.’ 471: _Horn serui le
rei bien de la cupe acel ior_.

264 ff. Cf. the apparently borrowed scene in ‘Rich. C. de L.’ vv. 879
ff., where the princess falls in love with the captive Richard and bids
the jailer, “_And aftir soper, in the evenyng, To my chaumbyr thow hym
bryng In the atyr of a squyer_” (909-11).

266. _He_ = ‘she’ as elsewhere (OE. _hēo_): _mest in þoȝte_. For similar
phrase cf. Wissmann 254 Note.

268 _wexe wild_. A popular word combination. Cf. ‘Proverbs of Hendyng’
(Böddeker’s ed.) 121: _Ne wax þou nout to wilde_ (Wissmann).

275. _Bi daie ne bi niȝte_. Cf. ‘Erl of Tolous’ 42: _Be dayes and be
nyght_. ‘Launfal’ 412: _Be dayes ne be nyȝt_. ‘Lay.’ 13829: _bi dæie no
bi nihtes_, etc.

282. _him þuȝte_. Cf. Wissmann’s note with incorrect reference to ‘Lay.’
312. See present volume, 268 Note.

300. _wed broþer_. Cf. Glossary.

315. _sette him on bedde_. The usual mode of entertainment. Cf. ‘Beues
of Hampton’ (E.E.T.S.) 1090; ‘Guy of W.’ (E.E.T.S.) 3043; ‘Sir Eglamour’
679: _sche sett hym on hur beddys syde_.

319 ff. For other instances of the maiden wooing the man see ‘Beues of
H.’ 1093 ff.; ‘Amis and Amiloun’ 550 ff.: ‘Sir Eglamour’ 674 ff., etc.

321. _trewþe pliȝte_. Cf. ‘Sir Eglamour’ 674: _Therto ther trowthys they
plyght_. ‘Erl of Tolous’ 210: _Therto my trouth y plyght_, etc.,
frequently.

333. _bi one ribbe_. Not clear. Cf. Wissmann’s Note, also Kölbing (Engl.
Stud. vi. 155), who translates _bi_, ‘_im bezug auf_,’ ‘with reference
to.’

341. _fule þeof_. Cf. ‘Havelok’ 1780: _Goth henne swiþe fule þeues_
(Wissmann).

350. _mote þu deie_. Cf. ‘Rich. C. de L.’ 6858: _God geve the wel evyl
pyne_; 6862, _God geve you wel evyl endyng_.

364. _hou one_. Cf. 559 C H, 650 C H, also Glossary. The OE. weak form
_āna_ seems to have the same experience as _seolfa_, ‘self.’

366. _vs wroþe_. _wroþe_ means ‘fearful’ (Mätzner).

373. _makede hire bliþe_. Cf. ‘Havelok’ 2244, ‘Rich. C. de L.’ 1606
(Wissmann).

378. _squieres wise_. Cf. 264 Note.

379, C. _pleie_. Cf. ‘Lyb. Disc.’ 25-26: _As hyt befelle upon a day To
wode he wente on hys play_.

387-8. _kyng on benche_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 14963-4: _& heo gon scenchen, on þas
kinges benche_. Also ‘Ipomydon’ 229: _Of þe cuppe ye shall serve me_.
Cf. also 1185.

403. _On knes he him sette_. The conventional mode of salutation. Cf.
‘Lay.’ 22147-8: _Comen to þan ki[n]ge, & setten an heore cneowen_. Cf.
also ‘Lay.’ 13821 and ‘King of Tars.’ 719: _& gret hir feir vpon his
kne_, also 90, 221. ‘Guy of Warwick’ 161-2: _Gye on his kneys sone hym
sett, And that mayden feyre he grett_. ‘Rich. C. de L.’ 891-3, 1591;
‘Ypotis’ 15: _On his kne he hym sette. Well fayr þe emperour þer he
grette._ ‘Ipomydon’ 267-8: _Ipomydon on knees hym sette And the lady
feyre grette_. 187-8: _Vppon {his} knees he hym sette, And þe kyng full
feyr he grette_. Cf. also 902-3, also ‘Erl of Tolous’ 1066: _To the
emperour he knelyd blyve_. Cf. Wissmann’s Note.

405-6. _of his feire siȝte ..._ Cf. ‘R. H.’ 1053: _De la belte de horn
tute la chambre resplent_. Compare with this the flame which came from
Havelok’s mouth when he slept.

420. _honde_. Cf. ‘Ipomydon’ 2164: _Ipomydon toke hyr by the hond_. Cf.
also ‘Havelok’ 408; ‘Amis and Am.’ 550 ff.; ‘Guy of W.’ 217 ff.; ‘Rich.
C. de L.’ 891-3: _Fayr he grette that lady bryght, And sayde to her with
herte free, What is thy wille, Lady, with {me}_.

425. _ofte heo hine custe ..._ Cf. ‘Lay.’ 5012-14: _bitwixen hire ærmes
heo hine nom, ofte heo hine clupte, & ofte heo hine custe_.

436. _liþe_. Cf. ‘Life of Alex.’ 431: _He wol solace me and lythe and in
this care make me blythe_, and ‘Will. de Shoreham’ (ed. Wright), p. 19:
_and lytheth oure pyne_.

437. _wiþute strif_. Cf. ‘Erl of Tolous’ 240: _Wythoute any stryfe_.
‘Ipomydon’ 1607-8: _He sayd, he wold haue hyr to wyffe, If she wold
withouten stryff_.

440. _plist_. Cf. 10 Note: _trewþe_. Cf. 321 Note, also Wissmann’s Note.

441-2. _biþoȝte_ : _miȝte_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 28410-11: _Modred þa þohte, what
he don mihte_ (Wissmann).

450, H. _þy fader fundlyng_. An instance of the preservation of the OE.
‘irregular’ genitive form. Cf. also 116 C H, 951 H; _moder_ 1485 C.

451. _... cunde_. ‘It would not be in keeping with thy rank’ (Mätzner).

452. _welde_. Cf. 324.

454. _wedding_. Cf. Wissmann’s ref. to Grimm, Rechtsalt. 439.

458. _iswoȝe_. Swoons are frequent in mediaeval romance. Cf. ‘Ipomydon’
873-8: _Uppon hyr bedde she gan downe falle On swoone, afore hyr maydens
alle_. Cf. also Wissmann’s Note.

464. _stere_. Cf. ‘Ritson’ III. 35, 825: _Ther myght no man hure stere_
(Wissmann).

favourite amusement at the time of the Danish invasions, as we know from
the life of Alfred.

parallel citation from ‘The Squire of L. D.’. 507 ff.: _his drawen swerd
in his hande, There was no more with him wolde stande_.

779. _haue wel godneday_. Common form of parting salutation. Cf. ‘Lay.’
26002, 32187 (Wissmann); also ‘Rich. C. de L.’ 106: _Lemman haue thou

also ‘Assumption’ 142 C, 288 A.

783-4. _wune þere_ : _seue ȝere_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 29437-8, also 30088-9
(Wissmann). Seven years, like seven days, is a period of time
conventional in romance. Cf. ‘Squire of L. D.’ 117: _I haue thee loved
this seven yere_. Also ‘Beues’ 1274, 3835, 3897, etc. Cf. also Grimm,
Rechtsalt. 214.

798. _Kep wel_. Cf. ‘Beues’ 2372: _I pray þe kepe wel Iosian_.

distinguished from estnesse; Aylmer’s kingdom as distinguished from

ich nauere ær swulche cnihtes_. Cf. also 180-2, also ‘Beowulf’ 246-7:

834. Cf. 403 Note.

836. Cf. ‘Lay’ 13816 ff.

838, L. _hauen to done_. Cf. ‘Seven Sages’ 452: _With me ne hadde he

Ac he hit aleyde sone_ (Wissmann).

839. _bitak ... to werie_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 3021 (Wissmann).

841. _faireste man_. ‘Lay.’ 13797-8: _þis weoren þe færeste men þat
auere her comen_.

848. _Tak him þine glorie_. Cf. Wissmann, Note, also Kölbing (Engl.
Stud. vi, 156). The glove had many significations. It might be used as a
sign of challenge (cf. ‘Erl of Tolous’ 1100); or it might signify a
handing over of authority from a superior to a subordinate (Grimm,
Rechtsalt. 154, 4). It is in this latter way that Kölbing believes the
word to be used here in Horn. When a prince for any reason left his
land, he must leave some one behind, _to hold the court_ (‘Sir
Tristrem,’ v. 1985), and must supply this one with the badge of
authority. This opinion of Kölbing’s seems very plausible. It is
interesting, however, to note two other uses of the glove. Cf. ‘Rich. C.
de L.’ 5696-1: _Thertoo I holde, Thertoo my glove_ (= ‘make agreement’).
And ‘R. H.’ 909-11 C: _E horn uent cuntre li cumme il iest costumez, E
lespée e les gaunz sire dist ca donez, Issil soleit faire ainz quil fust
encusez_. The clue to the meaning might be suggested by either one of
these phrases. One thing seems certain; in our poem (K. H.) the king’s
meaning is that Horn should be left at home. This is the meaning in
R. H. 2324-6: _Si alez doneer k’od vus ne le menez, K’il est de belté
issi inluminez. Ke vus là ù il ert, petit serrez preisez._

861, C. _site stille_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 28173, 24866: _sitteð adun stille
cnihtes inne halle_ (Wissmann).

867 ff. Regarding the custom of single combat, cf. ‘Publ. of Mod. Lang.
Assoc. of America’ xv. pp. 228, 230. Cf. also the triple combat in
‘Rich. C. de L.’ 5691 ff. Cf. also the Arundel MS. version (French) of
‘Havelok,’ in which Havelok overcomes Hadulf in single combat and thus
regains his Danish kingdom.

876-7. _þat on_ : _þat oþer_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 29215-16: _him seoluen he heol
þat ane, Isembard þat oðer_.

881-2. _to rede_ : _alle dede_. Cf. ‘Havelok’ 118: _Louerd what schal me
to rede_; Böddeker, G. L., ix. 16, _sone, what shal me to rede_
(Wissmann). Also ‘Lay.’ 13904-5: _her-of þou most ræden, oðer alle we
beoð dæden_.

886. _wiþ_ used in the OE. sense ‘against.’ Cf. the use of _on_ (= ‘in’)
and _at_, 619 Note. (= ‘from’) in Glossary.

895, H. _ros of bedde_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 6717: _þe king aros of bedde_
(Wissmann).

904, H. _to gedere smiten_. ‘Lay.’ 25605: _heo smiten heom to-gaderen_
(Wissmann).

909. _on a grene_. Inconsistent with ‘_at Cristesmasse_,’ v. 853.

911 ff. Cf. Wissmann’s Note.

921-2. _King Mory_. This is one of several references to a fuller,
longer tale, in which Murry must have played a more important rôle. Cf.
vv. 4 ff. and the abrupt introduction of Arnoldin, 1561.

925. _agrise_. Cf. ‘King of Tars.’ 1202: _so sore hem gan agrise_.

931. _rynge_. Unlike the ring in the Scotch ballads and in H. C. the
ring in this version serves as a protection.

933-4. _smerte_. Cf. ‘Havelok’ 2646: _þorw þe brest unto þe herte þe
dint bigan ful sore to smerte_ (Wissmann).

935. _sturne_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 25841, 6732 (Wissmann).

947-8, H. _stounde_ : _grounde_. Cf. ‘Rich. C. de L.’ 4537-8: _Soone,
withinne a lytyl stounde The moste party yede to grounde_.

952. _fader_. OE. gen. sing. Cf. 116 ‘C. H.’

964 ff. Cf. the similar offer made to Brennes by Sequin, ‘Lay.’ 4919 ff.

974. _lofte_. In the sense ‘women’s apartments’ seems to be of Norse
origin. Cf. Skeat, Etymol. Dict., also Wissmann, 928 Note. Cf. also
1050 L. It seems probable that the women’s apartments were in the
‘tower.’ Cf. also Kölbing (Engl. Stud. vi. 155).

1002-3. _dude_ seems to be used in the modern, intensive sense, and not
as ‘cause to’ or ‘put.’

1010-11. For similar situations cf. ‘Guy of W.’ 1315-16: _On huntyng Gye
went on a day, He mett a palmer by the way_. Also ‘Erl of Tolous’ 937-8:
_He rode on huntyng on a day, A marchand mett he be þe way_. Cf. also
‘Beues’ 1300 ff.

1021-2. _wedde_ : _bedde_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 31126-7 B: _he þat maide weddede,
and nam hire to his bedde_.

1024, H. _enimis_. Perhaps trace of OF. nom. sing. ending in _-s_, due
to French scribe. Cf. 123 Note.

1034. _bidere_, error for _bitere_ (?).

1056. _wringe_. Cf. ‘Ipomydon’ 876: _Hir handes fast gan she wrynge_.

1068. _linne_. Hortative (?).

1073. _kniȝt mid þe beste_. A common phrase. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 20449, etc.

1077-8. _sonde_ : _londe_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 28676-7: _and sende his sonde wide
ȝeond his londe_.

1089. _striken_. Stratmann suggests ‘strip.’

1091-2, H. _yronge_ : _ysonge_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 29441-2: _no belle irungen.
no masse isunge._

1093. _word bigan to springe_. Cf. ‘Havel.’ 959: _of him ful wide þe
word sprong_. ‘Lay.’ 26242: _Wel wide sprong þas eorles word_
(Wissmann). Also ‘King of Tars.’ 1065: _þe word wel wide sprong_. ‘Lyb.
Disc.’ 264 ff.: _Hys name ys spronge wide_.

1102. _sprunge of stone_. The simile is one of quickness that of a spark
from the stone in striking a light, like modern “quick as a flash.” Cf.
_He sprange als any spark one glede_, ‘Sir Isumbras,’ 451.

1103-4. _mette_ : _grette_. A very common rime. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 31041-2: _þer
he hine mette and fæire hine grette_. ‘Beues’ 2051-2: _þar wiþ a palmer
he mette, And swiþe faire he him grette_.

1117. _nolde_. Cf. ‘Lay’ 28900: _and seiden þat he nolde_.

1118 L. _ispused wiþ golde_. Reference, probably, to an old custom of
buying the bride.

1121. _Myd strencþe_. Cf. ‘Squire of L. D.’ 443 (Wissmann).

1132 ff. _chaungi wede_. Compare with this ‘Beues’ 2051 ff., where Beues
meets a palmer, learns from him the news, exchanges garments with him,
and in disguise goes to see Iosiane after an absence of seven years.
Disguises are an almost universal feature of these mediaeval tales. Cf.
Brian’s disguise in ‘Pierre de Langt.’ (Rolls Series), pp. 248-350. Cf.
also disguises in ‘Guy of W.’, ‘Layamon’ (17637 ff.), ‘Ypomydon,’ ‘Rich.
C. de L.,’ ‘Isumbras,’ etc. They are frequent in Germanic story from the
stories of Thor down.

1134. _sclauyne_. Cf. ‘Rich. C. de L.’ 611-12: _with pyke and with
sclavyn, As palmers were in Paynim_.

1139. _horn his_ = Hornes, evidently due to scribe’s mistake in hearing.

1144. _bicolmede_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 17700-1, _iblæcched he hæfde his licame:
swulc ismitte of cole_.

1147-8. _gateward_. Cf. ‘Ipomydon’ 245-6: _They com to the
castelle-gate, The porter was redy there at_.

1155. _abugge_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 3841, 8159 (Wissm.).

1158, L. _rake_. Cf. ‘Beues’ 2183: _Let me wiþ þe reke_.

1164. _ȝerne_. Cf. Ritson, II. 25, 589: _þe mayde cryde yerne_ (Wissm.).

1184 ff. Cf. the story of Brian, ‘Lay.’ III., pp. 234-8: Brian,
disguised as a palmer, enters the banqueting hall. Galarne, his sister,
the queen, serves the guests to drink from a bowl. She recognizes Brian,
and gives him a ring in token of recognition.

1185-6. _benche_ : _schenche_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 14963-4: _& heo gon scenchen
on þas kinges benche_. Cf. also ‘Beowulf,’ 1226-54.

1190. _so laȝe was in londe_. Cf. ‘Rich. C. de L.’: _Thenne as hit was
lawe of land_ (Wissm.).

1191-2. _Hye drank of þe bere To knyt and to squiere_. An old Germanic
custom. Cf. Wissmann, ‘Untersuchungen’ (‘Q. u. F.’ xvi. Strassb., 1876),
p. 110.

1202. _brune_. Cf. Wissm., 1142 Note, also Kölbing (‘Engl. Stud.’ vi.
156). Wissmann takes _brun_ to be a collective referring to ‘beer.’
Kölbing, with greater probability, takes _brun_ to mean an ordinary
brown horn, as distinguished from the _cuppe white_, which she has laid
down, 1201.

1204. _glotoun_. The same phrase in Wolfram’s ‘Parz.’: _si wænde, er
wære ein garzūn_ (Wissm.).

1206. _þing_, probably a mistake for _ring_. Cf. 479-80.

1240. _vnder wude liȝe_. Cf. ‘Lay’: _Ich eou wille leden forð to mine
lauerd i þon wade rime þer he under rise lið_ (Wissm.).

1259. _bi seint gile_. Cf. Wissm. 1197 Note. Cf. also 829 Note.

1275. _custe_. Cf. ‘Erl of Tolous’ 401: _And kyssyde hyt fele sythe_.
Cf. also 425 Note.

1281-2. _Heo feol on hire bedde_. Cf. ‘Erl of Tolous’ 871, 875: _He hent
a knyfe with all his mayn ... And fell {in} swoun upon hys bedd_; also
‘Ipomydon’ 871 ff.: _Uppon hyr bedde she gan downe falle_. Cf. also 458,
792.

1282, H. _gredde_. Cf. ‘Beues’ 2151: _After Bonefas ȝhe gan grede_.

1297, L, H. _kuste_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 15017-18, 5012-14.

1304. _wroþe_. Cf. 366 Note.

1311-12. _bure_ : _ture_. Cf. ‘Havelok’ 2072-3: _I shal lene þe a bowr
þat is up in þe heye tour_.

1321-2. _ywis_ : _blis_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 7605-7 B: _Mochel was þe blisse þat
hii makede mid iwisse_.

1335. _wunder_. Cf. Mätzner 1247 Note.

1336. _falsede_. Early instance of a hybrid word.

1398. _crouch_. Lat. _crucem_, OE. _cruce_.

1410. _hym agros_. Cf. 925 Note.

1419. _kepe þis passage_. Cf. ‘Beowulf’ 230 ff.: _se þe holmclifu
healdan scolde_, etc.

1420. _of age_. This phrase seems to have very nearly its modern
meaning, and if so, is probably the earliest recorded instance. Cf. New
Oxford Dict.

1422. _bi este_ C, _by weste_ L H. This confusion, here as elsewhere,
seems due to changing points of view. _Westernesse_ is of course west to
_Suddenne_, and both are east to _Yrlonde_.

1428. _þe riȝte_, direct. Cf. Wissmann, 1356 Note.

1462. _I blessed beo þe time_. Cf. ‘Havel.’ 1215; ‘Chron. of Engl.’ 705
(Wissmann).

1465-6. _teche_ : _speche_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 26544: _for þus we eou scullen
techen ure Bruttisce speche_, and 26834: _Nu is we wulle teche Bruttisce
spæche_. For a very similar use cf. ‘Lay.’ 18424-25: _we scullen heom to
teon & tiðende tellen_; 20605-6, _and we heom sculleð tellen Bruttisce
{spelles}_; 21698, _sorhfulle spelles_; 24942, _ȝeomere spelles_. In all
these instances, as in the phrase in K. H., the meaning seems to be to
inflict dire punishment. Cf. also ‘Lay.’ 23503-4: _& techen heō to riden
þene wæi touward Romen_.

1467-8. _sle_ : _fle_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 6417-18: _oðer mid fure he lette hom
slæn · oðer he heom lette quic flan_. Cf. also ‘Lay.’ 27376-7, 29049-50;
‘Life of Alex.’ 1734 (Wissmann). Cf. also ‘Havelok,’ 612: _He shal hem
hangen, or quik flo_. For details of the flaying, cf. ‘Havelok’ 2492 ff.

1469. _horn to blowe_. In both French versions of ‘Havelok,’ Havelok
proves his identity in Denmark by his ability to blow the horn which
Sigar presents to him, and which no one else can blow. Cf. also ‘Beues’
3377: _Saber is horn began to blow, þat his ost him scholde knowe_. Cf.
also Roland’s horn in the Song of Roland and a similar incident in the
German romance, ‘König Rother.’

1481-2. _wurche_ : _churche_. Cf. ‘Lay.’ 10205-6: _chirchen he lettē
areren monie & wel iwhare_; also 29531-2.

1483-4. _ringe_ : _singe_. Cf. ‘Havelok’ 242: _Belles he deden sone
ringen, monkes and prestes masse singen_ (Wissmann).

1487, L. _cleten_. Scribal error for _clepten_.

1501-2, L H. _ston ... lym ..._ The combination of stone and lime is
probably a sign of French influence on MSS. L and H. Cf. R. H. 5047: _de

they are French words with French meanings.

exact equivalent of _nature_; hence in T, _of man_ is added.

692, 697, C. _him_. Further traces of grammatical gender. Cf. 448, C
Note.

[_Differences between this e-text and the printed book_

Sidenotes giving leaf-and-column information were often abbreviated for
space. The forms “lf.” and “bk.” have been silently regularized to
“leaf” and “back”. The full word “leaf” has been supplied where missing,
except in references to the Trentham MS., where it was consistently
omitted in the original.

Notes were variously printed in the side margin or at the bottom of
the page, depending on space constraints. They have been treated as
footnotes or sidenotes according to their function: information about
the text or MS. (footnote), leaf- or column numbering (sidenote),
narrative summary (sidenote). Where more than one MS was used, narrative
sidenotes are shown at the beginning of each group of lines.

The recurring words “No gap in MS.” are in the original; they are
generally followed by one or more blank lines inserted to keep the texts
parallel. The words are retained in _King Horn_ to preserve the editor’s
line numbering; in the other texts they were retained only when needed
to prevent ambiguity. The notation [[empty line]] in double brackets was
added by the transcriber.

Line numbering is as in the original. Printed numbers have been silently
regularized to the EETS-standard multiple of 4.

Each page of _King Horn_ was divided into three: the Cambridge and Laud
versions in adjoining columns, and the Harleian across the bottom, with
lines printed in pairs separated by a | divider. For this e-text, the
Harleian text has been broken into single lines to match the other two.
General sidenotes were originally printed in the Harleian section.

Except for footnote markers and Transcriber’s Notes, all brackets [ ]
are in the original.


_Other Texts_

At time of preparation, the three diagrams shown in the Preface were
available online at The Internet Archive:

  Wissmann on King Horn:
  http://www.archive.org/details/dasliedvonkingh00wissgoog
  (page n16)

  Herzog on Floris and Blancheflur in Scandinavia:
  http://www.archive.org/details/diebeidensagenk00herzgoog
  (page n100)

  Hausknecht on Floris and Blancheflur:
  http://www.archive.org/details/florisandblaunc00hausgoog
  (page n131)

In the Introduction to Floris and Blancheflur, the English passages
printed alongside the French version are from Hausknecht’s edition.


_Inconsistencies_

Introduction:

The forms “H Z”, “HZ.” and “H. Z.” (for “Haupt’s Zeitschrift für
deutsches Alterthum”) each appear once.

The term “X type” (of OE. rime) appears both with and without period,
and in both bold and ordinary type.

Some references to Hempl’s test have “_-wǭ-_, _-wō-_” instead of the
expected “_-wǭ-_, _-wọ̄-_”. These are shown as printed.

In a few paragraphs, the abbreviation “O.E.” has been silently
regularized to “OE.”

General:

The abbreviations “V.” and “Cott.” (see beginning of Glossary) refer to
the same MS., Cott. Vitell. D. III.

“MS. Gg. 4. 27. 2.” is written both with and without final period
(full stop).

When the editor is writing in his own voice, the Introduction uses “æ”
while the notes use “ae”. Middle English is always “æ” (one letter);
Latin is always “ae” (two letters).

The Laud MS. always has “c{r}ist...” instead of the more common
“c{ri}st...”

In the Notes, anomalous quotation marks such as ‘R. H.’ for R. H.
(without quotes) are unchanged.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
